  <h1 class='c006'>THE TURNED-ABOUT GIRLS</h1>
</div>

<div>
  <h2 id='chI' class='c007'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />STRANGERS ON THE LIMITED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>At Chicago, on a hot afternoon in early summer,
two little girls got aboard the car on the
Limited that was bound through to Boston. Both
little girls had bobbed brown hair and brown eyes
and both were going on eleven, but there all likeness
between them ended.</p>

<p class='c009'>The larger of the two little girls wore a black
silk frock embroidered with amber-colored butterflies
and curlicues, and black silk knickerbockers.
The socks that stopped just below her sturdy brown
knees were of black silk, and her black sandals had
tiny buckles of onyx. She wore a hat of fine black
straw, and in her arms she carried a little black
vanity bag, two big books with colored pictures on
their jackets, and a box tied up in white paper and
gilt cord that screamed—and smelled—of chocolates.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before her walked a solemn brown porter, laden
with suitcases and handbags and hatboxes. Behind
her walked a worried young woman, in a fresh blue
linen suit. Thus attended the little girl passed
along the aisle, with the air of a good-natured
young princess, and vanished into the drawing-room
at the end of the car. When the solemn-looking
porter came out of the drawing-room, he was no
longer solemn but smiling, and the piece of silver
that he pocketed was large and round.</p>

<p class='c009'>The smaller of the little girls had watched this
progress admiringly, but without envy. She was a
serious little girl, and this was her first long journey
in the world. She sat very still in her seat, which
was back to the engine, and she clasped a doll tight
in her arms. The doll wore a neat print dress and
frilled underclothes, and though the day was hot,
a crocheted sweater and a cunningly made hood.
The little girl herself wore a dress of pink and white
checked gingham which was a little faded and a
little short for her. Her hat was of white straw
with a wreath of pink flowers, and her socks were
white, and so were her buttoned boots. Over her
arm she carried a knitted sweater coat of red, and
at her feet stood a large suitcase which had seen
much travel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you see the little girl in black?” she whispered
to the doll, whose name was Mildred. “Do
you s’pose she’s in mourning for somebody? Well,
people can be just as sorry inside—we know it, don’t
we, Mildred?—even if they have to wear last summer’s
clothes, and they happen to be pink.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mildred was a very intelligent doll. She had
steady blue eyes, a sweet smile, and a shock of flaxen
curls. She showed her intelligence by always listening
sympathetically and never speaking. So she did
not let on now that she saw tears in her young
mother’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meantime in the drawing-room the little girl in
black silk had put down her books and her bag, and
hung up her hat, and rung for the porter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want a pillow,” she told the worried young
lady who accompanied her, “and a table so I can
play Canfield and—oh, yes! I want a big long drink
of lemonade.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid the porter won’t come till the train
has started,” the young lady told her. “Can’t you
read your books until then? What are they?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The little girl resigned herself quite sweetly to
going without her pillow and her table, and even
her lemonade. She sat down beside her companion
and showed her the books.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This one is about Robin Hood,” she said, “but
I’ve heard of him before. This other one is some
book!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear!” the lady murmured in rebuke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll say it is!” the little girl affirmed. “I read
it nights in my berth till Auntie Blair switched off
my light. Some book, I’ll tell the world! It’s called
‘The Prince and the Pauper.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>And if a kind old guardian hadn’t happened to
give that little girl a gorgeous copy of the beloved
romance, when she left Los Angeles, and if the
little girl hadn’t “eaten it up,” and dreamed of it,
and lived herself into it on the long railway journey,
this story, as you soon will see, would never have
been written.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII' class='c010'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />MILDRED, MISTRESS OF CEREMONIES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>At the first call for dinner the little girl in the
drawing-room left her pillow, which had
grown hot, and her crayola outfit, which had long
since displaced the game of Canfield in her favor.
Very glad of the change, she went with her companion
into the dining car. They sat at a little
table, just big enough for two, with shining plated
ware and a starched white cloth, and a water bottle
plugged with a fresh napkin. The little girl
ate soup, and roast beef, and baked potatoes, and
asparagus, and vanilla ice-cream with lady fingers,
and some preserved strawberries besides.</p>

<p class='c009'>Back in the sleeping car the little girl in the
checked gingham had waited anxiously to see what
her neighbors would do when supper time came.
There was no one of whom she could ask questions.
She was in the conductor’s care, to be sure, but he
seemed to her a remote and very grand person.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently she saw that people about her, mothers
of families and tired-looking gray women who traveled
alone, were taking lunch boxes from their
bags. Some of them made the porter set up tables
for them, but the little girl would never have dared
ask such a service from the lordly black man. She
placed Mildred in a corner of her seat, and she
heaved up the suitcase, which she found almost too
heavy for her, and put it on the opposite seat, which
the gentleman with the massive watch chain had left
vacant some time ago, when he went (to her great
relief) into the smoking car. She opened the suitcase.
Inside it, neatly folded, were a fresh nightgown,
a change of underwear, a clean dress, in case
her trunk should go astray, a pair of knitted bed
shoes, sadly worn, a comb and brush, a fairylike
wardrobe which was all Mildred’s, and lastly a
pasteboard shoe box, full of lunch.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little girl took out the shoe box and opened
it with all sorts of precaution not to make crumbs
on the floor, or on the beautiful plush seat. In the
box were some peanut-butter sandwiches, a hard-boiled
egg, two doughnuts, four raisin cookies, some
soda crackers, an apple, and a piece of chocolate.
She was to eat the sandwiches that night, the egg
for breakfast, the crackers and chocolate for next
day’s lunch, and the sweets and the apple when she
pleased. She was to get water in her own cup,
there in the sleeper, and she was on no account to
go into the dining car, for the prices that they
charged were downright robbery, and like as not
there were ptomaines (whatever they might be!) in
the food. So the little girl ate her peanut-butter
sandwiches, and her cookies, and drank her cup of
water, and thought how wonderful it was to travel,
and how nice that she was not homesick—not at all,
scarcely!—and not the least bit afraid.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had put away the lunch box very carefully,
and she was undressing Mildred for the night, with
Mildred’s little nightgown, trimmed with Hamburg
edging, laid ready on the arm of the seat beside her,
when the little girl in black silk came strolling back
from the dining car. The little girl in gingham knew
that she was coming, but she had been taught that
it was not pretty to stare, so she kept her eyes glued
to the wee buttons on Mildred’s waistband.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nobody seemed to have taught the little girl in
silk, or, if so, they had had their labor for their
pains. She stopped short, very firmly planted in
the swaying car, and she smiled at Mildred who
smiled back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jacqueline, please!” said the worried young lady
in the blue linen suit, which was not so fresh as when
she wore it first aboard the train.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll come in a minute,” the silken Jacqueline told
her casually. “I want to talk to the doll.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At that the little girl in gingham looked up, as
she had been dying to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello!” said Jacqueline. She had a rebellious
mouth, and a square boyish chin, and brown eyes as
direct as a boy’s, that could be merry when they
chose—and just now chose.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little girl in gingham smiled shyly. She had
an oval face, pale olive in tint, not glowing with red
through the brown tan like Jacqueline’s. Her smile
was timid, and her brown eyes were soft.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She looks like a nice child,” thought the young
woman in linen, “and even if she isn’t, if Jacqueline
has made up her mind to know her, I’m helpless.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She washed her hands of her charge, as the saying
is, and went into the drawing-room. Don’t blame
her too severely! She was young, she was worn
out with a hard winter’s teaching, and after all,
Jacqueline, with her lordly ways, had been “wished
upon her.” She went into the drawing-room, and
Jacqueline, like one accustomed to getting her way,
sat down in the place that the little girl in gingham
eagerly made for her in the seat at her side.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />A BOND IN COMMON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“What’s your name?” asked Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little girl in gingham blushed and
kept her eyes fixed on Mildred’s buttons.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Caroline,” she said, in a small voice. “For my
grandmother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My name’s Jacqueline Gildersleeve,” cut in her
companion. “At school they call me Jackie. I’ll
let you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline smiled shyly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I like Jacqueline better,” she said. “It’s like
trumpets and red sunsets.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline turned in the plush seat and looked at
her, much impressed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re a funny kid,” she said. “How can anybody’s
name be like a trumpet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But names are all music and things,” the little
girl in gingham insisted. “That’s why I don’t care
for Caroline. It’s like a bushel of wheat. Muzzy
always called me Carol. That’s a nice name—like
Christmas trees, and snow outside, and yellow
candles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is your mother with you?” asked Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” Caroline answered, and made herself very
busy with Mildred’s nightdress. “My mother is—dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” said Jacqueline blankly, and seemed for a
moment unable to think of anything else to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She died last winter,” Caroline went on, in her
patient little voice. “That’s why I’m going to my
half-aunt Martha. Have you—lost somebody,
too? I see you’re wearing black.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, that’s just not to show dirt,” Jacqueline
explained. “But I haven’t any mother nor father.
They died ages ago. Aunt Edie takes care of me,
and Judge Blair is my guardian. Have you got a
father?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline shook her head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Daddy died three years ago when everybody
had the flu. He was on a newspaper. My mother
gave music lessons. We had a room with the piano
in it, and a gas flat we cooked breakfast on, and a
couch that pulled out and made a bed for us both.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was very clear that Caroline was talking
against time. Equally clear that the brown eyes
that she kept obstinately fixed on Mildred were filling
fast with tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline tumbled out of her seat, just missed a
stout old lady as she caromed down the aisle, and
vanished into the drawing-room. Before Caroline
had dried her eyes—and Caroline was not slow
about it, either!—Jacqueline was back, and in her
hand was a big satin-covered box.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have some chocolates?” she urged, as she slid
into the seat beside Caroline. “Those big whales
are scrumptious, only they’re full of goo. Hold
your hanky under your chin when you bite into
them! Here, I’ll take your doll.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline took Mildred on her lap, very carefully,
to Caroline’s great relief. She examined the
trimming of her small, clean nightgown and tenderly
slipped her into the little flowered crêpe kimono,
while Caroline still struggled with the gooey chocolate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What cunning little ducky clothes!” cooed
Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My mother made ’em,” Caroline spoke thickly
because of the chocolate. “She could make most anything.
She made my dress, too—it was for best last
summer, but I’ve grown since then. She knitted my
sweater, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline bent her head and stroked the red sleeve
dumbly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have another chocolate,” coaxed Jacqueline.
“Have a lot! Try the one that’s like a porcupine!
Have a gummy one!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I dassen’t,” said Caroline. “I’ve got a hole in
my tooth, and caramels always make it ache.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s too bad,” agreed Jacqueline. “I’ve got
braces in my mouth so I can’t eat caramels at all.
Oh, well, I’ll give ’em to the Fish.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline looked at her questioningly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mean Miss Fisher,” said naughty Jacqueline
mincingly. “The piece of cheese I’m traveling
with.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean the lady in the blue dress?” asked
Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline nodded and cuddled Mildred to her.
She looked quite gentle until she smiled, and then the
imps of mischief crinkled in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Auntie Blair changed at Chicago for Montreal,
and I’m to go East with Miss Fisher that she knew
ages ago in college. She’s a fuss. She didn’t want
me to speak to you. And she’s not my aunt or anything.
I shall talk to you as long as I want to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline longed to say: “Please do!” She was
fascinated with this bold little girl, who used words
her mother had never let her utter, and was afraid
of nobody, not even the black porter or the august
conductor. But she hardly dared say: “Please
do!” She only smiled vaguely and picked a small
chocolate-covered nut from the satin box.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you go to school?” Jacqueline asked abruptly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes,” stammered Caroline. “I’ll go into the
sixth grade in September. That is, I would have gone
into it. I don’t know what school I’ll be in, where
I’m going.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you like school?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline looked dubious.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I like the reading lessons and the history,” she
said. “I can’t do arithmetic. I’d rather play the
piano.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Play the piano!” Jacqueline repeated, as if she
couldn’t believe her ears. “You mean you <i>like</i> to
practice?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes!” said Caroline from her heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good <i>night</i>!” said Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t—don’t you?” faltered Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline, like the skipper in “The Wreck of the
Hesperus,” laughed a scornful laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I’m going to get out of it this summer,”
she boasted darkly. “I’ll tell my Great-aunt Eunice
I’ve sprained my thumb, or something. She hasn’t
seen me for years and years. I suppose she thinks
I’m a little goody-goody. Well, she’s going to get
the surprise of her life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline tossed her head defiantly, and Caroline
fairly glowed with admiration.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re not a bit afraid of strangers, are you?”
she quavered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline smiled in a superior way, as if to challenge:
“Bring on your strangers!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I <i>am</i>,” admitted Caroline. “And I don’t know
any of them. I never saw my half-aunt Martha,
and I don’t know anything about my half-cousins,
but I do hope they have a piano, and that there
aren’t too many babies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you like ’em?” queried Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I’m kind of tired of them,” Caroline confessed
shamefacedly. “I stayed with Cousin Delia
after Muzzy died, and she had twins besides two
odd ones, and when one fretted, the others always
kept him company.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ought to shake ’em,” counseled Jacqueline.
“Shake ’em good and hard. I would! You’re too
meek. Don’t you let your old half-aunt go and boss
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But—but she’s giving me a home,” persisted
Caroline. “That is, if we get along. If we
don’t——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?” said Jacqueline, with shameless curiosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose I’ll go to an—an Institution,” whispered
Caroline. “You know—orphan asylum.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” said Jacqueline, again blankly. There
seemed nothing more to say. But she did have
the inspiration to put Mildred into Caroline’s arms,
and Caroline hugged her dumbly, with her dark
little head bent low over Mildred’s sleek gold curls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’d better keep the chocolates,” said Jacqueline,
in a brisk little voice. “I always have lots, and
the box will be nice to put your doll’s clothes in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I oughtn’t to,” gasped Caroline, overcome
with the glory of the gift.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The box is mine,” snapped Jacqueline. “I can
give it away if I want to, can’t I? I’d like to see
the Fish stop me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly the hard little termagant softened. She
put her arm round Caroline and Mildred.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course your half-aunt will like you,” she
said, “and you’ll stay with her, and maybe there’s a
piano. Does she live in Boston?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” answered Caroline, nestling close to her
new friend. “She lives on a farm in a place called
Longmeadow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Longmeadow?” parroted Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I get off at a place called Baring Junction.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline suddenly squeezed Caroline in a hug
that really endangered Mildred.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you beat it?” she cried. “I get off at Baring
Junction, and I’m going to Longmeadow, just the
same as you!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c010'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />THE BIG IDEA</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The fact that the two little girls were going to
the same town was the finishing link in the
chain of friendship that they had forged so rapidly.
They talked that evening about their schools, and
their games, and the books they had read until Miss
Fisher and Caroline’s own sense of propriety plucked
them apart. In the morning they began where they
had left off, while Miss Fisher, who was quite exhausted,
after a car-sick night, remained aloof and
shook her head in utter helplessness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Miss Fisher’s car-sickness has a great deal
to do with the story. She was honestly feeling that
she could not endure another hour in the train,
when she received a telegram at Albany. Friends
of hers, whom she had not seen in months, a nice
girl and her even nicer brother (so Miss Fisher
thought), wired that they would meet her at the
train in Pittsfield and whisk her away for a blissful
week-end in the Berkshires before she went on to
her aunt’s house in Boston. For an instant Miss
Fisher thought of duty and the tiresome, unruly
child she had agreed to chaperon. Then she
thought of the deadly hours in the train, and the
nice girl’s even nicer brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Fisher lurched out into the car and captured
Jacqueline. To Jacqueline she explained
that she had to leave the train at Pittsfield, and that
Jacqueline would remain in the care of the conductor
and the porter till she reached Baring Junction,
where those officials would deliver her to her
great-aunt. Jacqueline was of course to be a very
good girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure!” promised Jacqueline—too readily, a suspicious
person might have thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Miss Fisher was too fluttered with her own
affairs to be suspicious. She tripped gayly off the
train at Pittsfield, into the arms of her friends, and
out of this story. Of course her conduct was quite
blameworthy, and so Jacqueline’s Aunt Edie and
several other people said later. Just the same
Jacqueline should not have called her a fish, and
certainly not a piece of cheese.</p>

<p class='c009'>The moment Miss Fisher’s rumpled blue linen
skirt had vanished from the car, Jacqueline laid hold
of Caroline’s suitcase and, like a valorous small ant
with a huge crumb, tugged it into the drawing-room.
Caroline snatched up her hat and her sweater, and
with Mildred in her arms followed after protesting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You come along,” Jacqueline over-rode her protests.
“We can sprawl all we want to in here, and
people won’t stop to stare at Mildred, and ask us
our names, and do we like to travel. Wouldn’t they
be peeved if <i>we</i> asked <i>them</i> questions like that, without
being introduced?”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Caroline and Jacqueline and Mildred settled
down to enjoy the privacy and comfort of the
drawing-room, without the disadvantages of Miss
Fisher’s presence. But somehow they didn’t enjoy
themselves much. For they couldn’t forget—that
is, Caroline and Jacqueline couldn’t, for I don’t
know about Mildred—that the pretty little gold
watch on Jacqueline’s wrist, with its madly racing
minute-hand, was tearing away the hours, so very
few now, before the train reached Baring Junction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to have a rotten summer,” complained
Jacqueline. “Oh, I wish I’d made Aunt Edie let
me go to a camp! Great-aunt Eunice is as old as the
hills and Cousin Penelope is most as old. It will
be poky at their house, and I can’t do this, or Aunt
Eunice will be scared, and I can’t do that, or Cousin
Penelope will scold. Oh, shivering chimpanzees!
I wish I’d gone to camp!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But poor little Caroline had no words for the
misery that possessed her, as the minutes ran by
and the hour came nearer that should deliver her
into the hands of grudging strangers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I hope half-aunt Martha’s boys aren’t big,”
she confided to Jacqueline. “I—I’m afraid of
boys.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not,” said Jacqueline. “I’d rather face fifteen
boys than one old piano.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I hope they don’t make me pitch hay or
drive cows—I’m scared of cows,” quavered Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d rather drive a million cows than have to be
starched up and on my good behavior with a pack
of tiresome aunts,” Jacqueline returned gloomily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” Caroline was goaded into crying. “If only
you were me, and I were you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline snorted derision. What’s the use of
wishing? Then her gaze wandered to the helter-skelter
heap of her belongings on the couch—hat-box,
vanity bag, coat, suitcase, books!</p>

<p class='c009'>Books! Her eyes fell on the gay jacket of “The
Prince and the Pauper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly she grasped Caroline’s arm so hard that
Caroline squeaked: “Ow!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t stop to <i>ow</i>!” bade Jacqueline. “Because
if you’ve got your nerve with you, I’ve got the
dandiest plan so you can have a piano this summer,
and no babies to tend, and no boys, nor nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline merely stared and held Mildred tight.
She really feared that the heat of the day had
affected Jacqueline’s head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your bossy old half-aunt has never seen you,”
went on Jacqueline, “and my Gildersleeve relations
haven’t seen me since I was three years old.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” nodded Caroline. That much she thought
it safe to grant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re each of them expecting a little girl most
eleven years old, with brown hair and eyes, and her
hair bobbed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” Caroline freely admitted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then!” Jacqueline concluded triumphantly.
“Suppose we go and change clothes, like Prince
Edward and Tom Canty in ‘The Prince and the
Pauper,’ and you say you’re me, and I say I’m you,—and
who’s to know the difference?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c010'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />TURNED-ABOUT GIRLS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was thoroughly wrong, the deception that
Jacqueline had suggested. She knew it was
wrong, but she didn’t care. As for Caroline, her
mind was such a jumble of cows and boys and fierce
half-aunts (so much more ogreish in suggestion than
whole aunts!) and an Institution, looming in the
background, that she hardly knew right from wrong.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only as she followed Jacqueline’s example and
began to unfasten her rumpled frock, she mustered
the spirit to falter:</p>

<p class='c009'>“But they’ll find out right away——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, they won’t, unless you’re a silly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But some day your Aunt Edith who knows you
will come——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not before September,” said Jacqueline
cheerily, “and by that time summer will be over, and
we’ll have had our fun. Think of the piano!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I don’t know what to do!” wailed Caroline.
She was a shivering little figure, barelegged, in her
underclothes, with her soiled and mussed checked
gingham in a heap at her feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now you do as I tell you,” counseled Jacqueline
in her most masterful manner. “Why, Caroline,
it’s nothing but a joke, and just the minute you want
to, we’ll change back. Be a good sport now! Come
on!” When Jacqueline smiled she was irresistible.
She smiled now. Caroline wavered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you don’t,” said Jacqueline sweetly, “you’re
a quitter, and I’ll never speak to you again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To lose Jacqueline, the one friend she had in this
new world into which she was being cast, was more
than Caroline could bear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not a quitter,” she vowed. “I’ll show you.
Wait till I get out some clothes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The big shabby much-traveled suitcase that was
Caroline’s, and the smart black leather case that was
Jacqueline’s, alike held fresh changes of clothes. In
these the little girls dressed themselves from the
skin out. Caroline gasped a little at the silk socks,
the delicate undergarments, the knickers and the
frock of henna-colored crêpe in which she rather
guiltily encased herself. Jacqueline tumbled gleefully
into cotton socks, much-mended plain cotton
underwear, and a fresh frock of brown and white
gingham, with a big patch in the back breadth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m bigger than you,” she chuckled. “These
clothes look awful skimpy on me. I’ll tell your half-aunt
that I shot up last winter. I did really, so it
isn’t a fib.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your clothes look—nice on me,” said Caroline,
as she caught a glimpse in the mirror of the strange
child into which she had turned herself. “They
fit me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s because they’re short for me,” Jacqueline
told her. “Aunt Edie has ’em made that way—it’s
the smartest thing, this year. She’d think you
looked dowdy with your skirt way down to your
knees, but probably Great-aunt Eunice won’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In a businesslike way she restrapped the black
leather suitcase.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s yours now, remember,” she told Caroline,
“and the hatbox, and the black hat, and the coat,
and my watch here,—don’t forget to wind it!—and
those two books, and the vanity bag. Hang on
to it! The check for my trunk—your trunk it will
be now—and the key to it are there in the little
purse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there’s money in it, too,” protested Caroline.
“Oh, Jackie, I can’t take your money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You won’t take much of it,” Jacqueline assured
her. “I shall slip three dollars to the porter, and
tell him not to give us away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline looked at her admiringly. She hadn’t
thought of the porter. She felt quite sure that if
ever a woman became president of the United
States, as she had heard was now possible, Jacqueline
would be that woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now sit down,” bade Jacqueline, and poked
Caroline into a seat. “We’re only half an hour
from Baring Junction——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” Caroline softly squeaked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t <i>oh</i>! We’ve got to get things straight
because they may ask questions. Now your father
was John Gildersleeve——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, he wasn’t!” protested Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ninny! Don’t you see—you’re me now—Jacqueline
Gildersleeve. Your father was John
Gildersleeve. He was born and brought up in
Longmeadow, and he and Cousin Penelope went
to school together. By and by he grew up,
and his father and mother died, and he went out to
California. He was in the oil business. My
mother—I mean, she’s your mother now—was
Marion Delane. Her father had a big ranch, with
horses and things, and Aunt Edith is her sister.
And she died—not Aunt Edith, but my mother that
you must call your mother—when my baby brother
came, and he died, too, and my father was killed the
next autumn in the oil fields. I’ve lived with Aunt
Edith ever since, and our place is called Buena
Vista—that’s Spanish for Fair View—and first I
had governesses, but last year I went to boarding
school. Aunt Edith married my new uncle Jimmie
Knowlton on the fifth day of June. He’s Colonel
Knowlton—he was in the air service—and he took
me up twice in his plane, and we did a tailspin—oh,
boy! He’s some uncle. But they didn’t want me
on their honeymoon—they’ve gone to Alaska—that’s
why I’m going to Great-aunt Eunice. She’s
wanted me to spend a summer with her for years
and years. I don’t believe she likes Aunt Edith
much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline paused at last for breath, and fixed her
eyes on the trembling Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you remember all that?” she asked sternly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I guess so,” Caroline answered dubiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll be all right,” Jacqueline encouraged.
“Aunt Edie hardly ever wrote letters to Great-aunt
Eunice, so she doesn’t really know much about us.
Now see if I remember what I’ve got to know. I’m
you now—Caroline Tait. My father was Henry
Tait, and he was born in Longmeadow, and he came
to Chicago years ago and was on a newspaper when
he died. And he met my mother out there, and her
name was Frances Meade, and she was a music
teacher, and none of the Longmeadow folks ever
saw her. And I’ve been living with her cousin,
Delia Meade, and I’m going to my father’s half-sister,
and her name is Martha Conway. Is that
all right?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” Caroline nodded, “but oh! I’ve just
thought. Won’t we have to write letters back to
your Aunt Edith and my Cousin Delia—and they’ll
see that the handwriting isn’t ours?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For as much as half a second, Jacqueline hesitated.
Then she rose to the occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve got two post-cards shut up in my Robin
Hood book. Quick! Write to your Cousin Delia
on this one that you’ve got safe to Baring Junction,
and your half-aunt met you and is very nice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I don’t know if she is!” protested truthful
Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve got to take chances sometimes,” Jacqueline
silenced her. “Hurry up and write, and I’ll
write one, too, to my Aunt Edie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hastily and in pencil the post-cards were written.
From a recess in the vanity bag Jacqueline dug out
two stamps, the worse for wear but still stickable.
These she fixed upon the cards.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The porter’ll post ’em,” she said. “That’ll
satisfy your Cousin Delia and my Aunt Edie—and
we’ve simply got to get out of writing them any
more letters, somehow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the black porter hammered at the door, and
Jacqueline bade him enter, and in her lordly manner
permitted him to brush her off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ain’ yo’ done mix yo’ clothes up, Missy?” he
asked with interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline quaked. Jacqueline merely dimpled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course we have,” she said. “We’re going to
put something over on our relations. You see, I
know her folks just like she knows mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>(Which was true in the letter, but not in the spirit.
Jacqueline might as well have told a fib and been
done with it.)</p>

<p class='c009'>The porter seemed to hesitate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be all right,” Jacqueline told him loftily.
“Here’s something for you. Take off that young
lady and her luggage as soon as the train stops. I’ll
look out for myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So sure of herself she was that the porter, like
Caroline, was put to silence. He pocketed the
money that she gave him, chuckled, muttered that
she was “de beatermost,” and went his way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll be there in five minutes now,” said Jacqueline.
“Put on this hat. Here, give me yours. Take
the books. Give me the doll.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no!” cried Caroline, and clasped Mildred to
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But look here,” said Jacqueline, “I’m you and
the doll is yours, so I’ve got to have her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I can’t—I can’t!” cried Caroline. “Not
Mildred! Don’t you see? Daddy gave her to me—the
Christmas before he died—and Muzzy made
all her clothes—I can’t give her up, Jackie—not
even to you—she’d be homesick.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now stop it!” commanded Jacqueline. “I don’t
want your silly old doll! Take her along with you.
It won’t give us away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But her clothes—they’re in my suitcase—your
suitcase—”</p>

<p class='c009'>Already Jacqueline was tearing open the shabby
suitcase.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shan’t gum the show now,” she panted.
“We’d look like—like a couple of boobs. Here are
the clothes. Take ’em, quick!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t get your suitcase open,” chittered Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train was slowing down for Baring Junction.
Moments counted. Jacqueline seized the nearly
emptied satin candy box and crammed its remaining
contents into the pockets of the brown and white
gingham that she wore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told you her clothes would go into the candy
box,” she said as she hastily crushed Mildred’s
wardrobe into the satin receptacle. “Take it quick—here’s
the porter—I’ll strap the suitcase.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Jackie!” Caroline turned wildly to her
friend, like a frightened kitten that doesn’t know
which way to run.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wipe your eyes, kid, and don’t weaken!” bade
Jacqueline stoutly. “Porter, take the books, too—her
hands are full. Beat it now, Carol! Ask for
Mrs. Eunice Gildersleeve and don’t forget there’s
sure to be a piano!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c010'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />CLAIMED AND CALLED FOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the wake of the grinning black porter, Caroline
stumbled out of the drawing-room. She had
only a few steps to take through the narrow passage
to the vestibule, and in those few steps she hadn’t
time enough to reconsider, and call up her courage
and run back to Jacqueline, with a refusal to go on
with this naughty deception. She had time only to
feel, in Jacqueline’s finery, like the poor little old
woman in the nursery-song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lawkamussy on me,</div>
      <div class='line'>This can’t be I!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then she stood in the swaying, cinder-powdered
vestibule. Through the open door she saw the dark
red walls of a country station creeping by and people
hurrying to be alongside the steps when the car
should stop. Strange people—hundreds of people,
they seemed to her. Oh, she wanted her half-aunt—she
even wanted the cows! Jacqueline’s Great-aunt
Eunice would be terrible. She would know at
once that Caroline was a little fraud. She would
send her away to an Institution.</p>

<p class='c009'>But now there was no turning back. The train
had stopped. The porter had leaped nimbly off. A
stout man in the vestibule behind Caroline was
bumping her silken calves with his heavy bag, and
fuming at her for blocking the way. Caroline
clutched Mildred tight to the bosom of Jacqueline’s
henna-colored frock, and scrambled down the steep
steps of the car. She was glad that the porter
steadied her with a hand on her arm. She felt so
sick and dizzy that she could scarcely see.</p>

<p class='c009'>A tall lady was beside her instantly. In the
strong sunlight of the station platform, so different
from the stuffy dusk of the train, Caroline could not
make out her features but she had an impression
of white clothes and she caught the scent of violets.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is Jacqueline, isn’t it?” the lady said, in a
clear, low voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline nodded, blinking between tears and sun-blindness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re Great-aunt Eunice?” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my dear,” said the low voice, with a ripple
of laughter in it. “She’s waiting over there in the
car. Bring along her things, Frank. Come quickly,
Jacqueline! Let’s get out of this frightful press.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The stout man had bumped the lady with his
clumsy bag, and his gruff “Beg pardon!” did not
seem in the least to mollify her. She put her gloved
hand on Caroline’s shoulder and hurried her away
across the wide platform, with its pillared red
roof.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the shade of the elm trees at the other side of
the platform a stately limousine was parked among
humbler touring cars and sedans. A stout elderly
lady looked eagerly from the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>One desperate glance Caroline cast behind her.
She saw a self-assured small figure, in a scant
brown and white gingham dress, propel itself down
the car steps, behind a big shabby suitcase. She
saw a squarely-built woman in an old straw hat
hurrying toward the car steps, and she saw the little
figure cast itself into her arms. Jacqueline had
taken possession of half-aunt Martha.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline had no chance to see more, for now she
was at the side of the limousine.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother, here’s Jacqueline,” said the lady in
white, who was evidently Jacqueline’s Cousin
Penelope. “This is Aunt Eunice, Jacqueline.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The old lady, who wore gray clothes and had
pretty white hair, nodded and smiled at Caroline
from her cozy seat. But Caroline, all confusion
and on the verge of tears, had no time to greet her,
for Cousin Penelope asked just then for the trunk-check.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s here—in my bag,” quavered Caroline, as she
struggled with the unfamiliar clasp of Jacqueline’s
vanity bag.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do help her, Penelope. She’s tired out, poor
little mite,” said Aunt Eunice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope took the bag in her brisk way,
and opened it. She made a queer little face, as she
saw the very grown-up small vials and powder-puff
inside, but she said nothing. By instinct, probably,
she opened the little purse and took out the trunk-check
and gave it to her chauffeur, who came up at
that moment with the hand-luggage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell them to send the trunk up by express,” she
bade him. “Jump in, Jacqueline. We’ll be away
from this wretched hot station in a couple of minutes
now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline stepped gingerly into the limousine.
With its cool gray upholstery, its little side-pockets
full of bottles and notebooks, its hanging crystal vase
of marguerites, it seemed to her a little palace on
wheels. She sank upon the cushions with a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You <i>are</i> tired, you poor little thing,” said Aunt
Eunice. “Now just rest. We won’t trouble you
with questions about the journey. You’re here safe—that’s
all that really matters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline nestled back in her seat and hugged
Mildred to her. The train that had sheltered her
had pulled out of the station. Jacqueline, her dear
and dangerous friend of twenty-four hours, was
gone. She had nothing left but Mildred.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope stepped into the car in a regal
manner. Her dress was of soft shimmery white,
and she wore a sweater coat of mauve silk, and a
white hat with a mauve silk scarf about the crown.
A faint scent of violets breathed from her when
she moved. Why, she wasn’t old like Aunt Eunice,
as Jacqueline had said she would be. She was young—not
so young, perhaps, as Caroline’s beloved Sunday
School teacher, but still young, and such a pretty
lady!</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank, the well-trained chauffeur, came at a
military gait across the sunny station platform. He
closed the door of the car, then stepped to his seat.
A moment later the great car glided—oh, so
smoothly and softly!—away from the platform and
under the elms of the station park into a wide street
where two-story brick buildings cast long shadows
in the late afternoon light.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are we going?” Caroline wondered.
“Oh, I hope it’s ever so far. If I could only sit here
with Mildred forever and ever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope pulled up a window.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I <i>know</i> the air is too much for you, Mother,”
she said crisply.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice seemed rather to sigh but she offered
no protest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By the way, Jacqueline,” Cousin Penelope turned
to Caroline who sat between the two ladies, “I
didn’t see that Miss Fisher, who was to look after
you from Chicago. I wished of course to thank
her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She got off at Pittsfield,” Caroline managed to
find her tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed!” said Cousin Penelope in an icy voice.
What things she could evidently have said to Miss
Fisher!</p>

<p class='c009'>“And left you to travel by yourself?” cried Aunt
Eunice. “No wonder she’s tired and upset, Penelope,
all alone like that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I played with a little girl,” explained Caroline,
“and I always have Mildred.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that your dolly’s name?” Aunt Eunice asked
quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice patted her hand with her soft plump
palm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s nice to see a little girl that loves dolls,” she
said. “Not many of them do, nowadays.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She smiled at Caroline, and Caroline, looking up
at her, smiled back. It didn’t matter whether she
were Jacqueline or Caroline—she knew that she was
going to like Aunt Eunice.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c010'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />LIKE A DREAM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Smoothly and softly the limousine glided out
from among the brick buildings of Baring
Junction—not a great many of them!—and along a
country road which was edged sometimes with a
rail fence, and sometimes with a stone wall, but
always with a green wayside growth of blackberry
and elderbush, alder, and in the low places, young
shoots of willow. Pastures slipped by the windows
of the car, and farm-yards, and meadows. Once
they drove slowly over a wooden bridge, with a roof
and sides that made a tunnel where their wheels
echoed in a rumbling, hollow fashion; and Caroline
wondered if Mildred were afraid.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then they came to a wide street, with green
lawns between the sidewalk and the road, and elms
that almost met above them. The street was bordered
with big comfortable houses, white or cream
or red, which were set well apart in lawns and
gardens, unlike the cramped suburban houses to
which Caroline was accustomed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is Longmeadow Street, dear,” explained
Aunt Eunice. “That brick house with the horse-chestnut
trees before it, is the John Gildersleeve
place, where your father was born, and his father
before him. And here’s the William Gildersleeve
place—our place—and we’ve got home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A smooth white driveway carried them behind a
tall hedge of box. The color and fragrance of an
old-fashioned garden were on the left hand, and on
the right a plushy green lawn, and a white house,
very square and big and substantial, with windows
set with many panes of glass.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s such an e-normous house,” thought Caroline,
in a panic.</p>

<p class='c009'>Would there be a butler? In the motion pictures
to which Cousin Delia had sometimes taken Caroline,
there were often butlers, and they were always
very proud and fat. And would she find a lot of
knives and forks at her place at table and not know
which one to use first? And would she be found
out at once and sent away in disgrace? She hoped
not—at least not until to-morrow! She couldn’t
stand it to meet any more new people today, now
that she had found Aunt Eunice so kind.</p>

<p class='c009'>They went from the porch through a wide doorway
with a paneled door and a big brass knocker,
into a long hall with a curving staircase. The dark
floor was as shiny as glass, and the white paint of
the woodwork was as dazzling as snow. The furniture
was of dark wood, with red winey gleams beneath
its polished surface.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a tall case of drawers, which seemed
by their weight to have bowed the slim legs
on which they rested, and a table—no, half a table—against
the wall. On the table were two brass
candlesticks, and between them a dull blue bowl,
which held some little, pale pink roses. Oh, if only
Muzzy had not taught her that she simply must not
stare! There was so much to see in this wonderful
house!</p>

<p class='c009'>At the top of the curved staircase was a long,
cool hall, with cream white doors on either side.
Aunt Eunice herself opened the third door on the
right.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This will be your room, my dear,” she said, and
motioned for Caroline to follow her across the
threshold.</p>

<p class='c009'>To Caroline it seemed as if she stepped suddenly
into a quiet green pool, the room was so still
and cool and goldeny green. There was a dull
green border to the oyster white rug that covered
the floor, and a pattern of wreathed leaves picked
out in green upon the pale gray furniture. Green
leaves where golden figures of canaries were half
hidden, made a deep frieze above the cool, pale
paper with which the walls were hung. The curtains
at the windows and upon the low book-shelves,
the cushions of the chairs, the covering upon the bed,
all had the same pattern of green leaves and gold
canaries. Outside the window that was opposite
the door, were the green, sibilant leaves of an elm,
and through them came the late sunshine in a
powdery dust of gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline said nothing. She just stared, in spite
of all that her mother had taught her. Then she
turned toward Aunt Eunice a quivering little face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>My</i> room?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, darling.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doesn’t anybody have to sleep with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not in that narrow bed, child. You’re not
afraid to be alone?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, no!” cried Caroline. “I like to be alone
with my thoughts, and all last winter——”</p>

<p class='c009'>She stopped. She could feel her heart beating
fast with the terror of a narrow escape. For she
had almost said that all last winter, in Cousin Delia’s
little house, she hadn’t had a corner to call her own,
no, nor a minute of time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind, dear,” said Aunt Eunice and
patted her shoulder gently.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there was a little pucker between Aunt
Eunice’s eyebrows. She was going to tell Penelope
later just what she thought of this Aunt Edith (not
on the Gildersleeve side of the family, thank goodness!)
who had packed that shy little sensitive girl
off to a boarding school!</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll want to rest a bit before dinner,” Aunt
Eunice filled up the awkward little pause, “and
wash, too, after the train. There’s the door to the
bathroom, over by the dressing-table. Can you manage
by yourself, or shall I send Sallie to help you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can manage, thank you!” Caroline assured her.</p>

<p class='c009'>To her own ears her voice sounded dry, and oh!
she didn’t want to seem ungrateful, when her heart
was just bursting with joy that was almost rapture.
So, as Aunt Eunice turned away, Caroline slipped up
to her side and laid a hand on her arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you!” she whispered shyly. “It’s—it’s
like a dream room and I—I’ll take awful good care
of everything. I can make my own bed,” she added
proudly. “And I can sweep and dust as nice as
anybody.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice beamed approvingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, what a sensible school your aunt must have
sent you to,” she said. “But you needn’t do tasks
in vacation, little girl. Sallie will take care of your
room. Now wash your hands and brush your hair,
and bring a good appetite with you to the dinner
table.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a nod and a smile—and Aunt Eunice’s smile
was the kind that you waited for eagerly, because
it made her whole face brighten—Aunt Eunice left
the room and closed the door behind her. Very
carefully Caroline put her coat (Jacqueline’s coat
that was!) and her hat and the satin candy box full
of doll-clothes down upon a chair, and then, with
Mildred in her arms, she walked slowly and almost
a-tiptoe with reverence round the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were pictures on the walls—lovely fairytale
pictures, such as she had seen in windows of
gorgeous shops, with cobalt blue seas and airy
mountains, towered castles and dark thickets shot
through with sunshine. There were pretty things
on the dressing-table—little trays and boxes of thin
china, patterned in green and gold, two slender perfume
bottles of cool green glass, a lovely little lady
in brocaded silk, with her hair piled high, whose
skirts when lifted revealed a hidden pin-cushion.
On the writing-desk by the window there was a
green blotter with gold and green leather corners,
and a brass owl, which was an inkwell, and a brass
turtle which miraculously was a stamp box. On the
little shelves of the desk were sheets of creamy
paper, large and small, and engraved on each sheet
was the legend: The Chimnies, Longmeadow,
Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear,” thought Caroline, “if only I could
write to somebody on this ducky paper, but I mustn’t
ever, because my handwriting isn’t Jackie’s, and it
would give us all away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a little sigh, she turned from the desk and
looked out at the windows. There were two of
them. The western window looked into the elms.
The northern window looked across some fields to a
low mountain, a great heap of dark trees and raw
red cliffs, which humped itself like a gigantic beast
against the sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline was gazing at the mountain, when there
came a rap at the door, and a neat middle-aged
maid, who must be Sallie, brought in her suitcase
(Jacqueline’s suitcase!) and the hatbox. Sallie
also offered to help Caroline wash her face. Dear
me! If Sallie had known the little girl was Caroline,
and not Jacqueline, she would have known that at
Cousin Delia’s Caroline had not only washed her
own face, but several other little faces besides.</p>

<p class='c009'>After Sallie had gone, Caroline opened the door
and went into the bathroom. It was not a bit like
Cousin Delia’s bathroom, with its golden oak woodwork
and its zinc tub which Caroline had so often
scrubbed. This bathroom was all white tiles and
shining nickel, and had a porcelain tub big enough
for half a dozen Carolines. On the nickel rods
were big towels and little towels and middle-sized
towels, thick towels and thin towels, rough towels
and smooth towels, all marked with a beautiful
big G.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline took off the henna-colored frock most
particularly, and she washed her face with some
very faintly scented white soap, not forgetting to
wash behind her ears, and she washed her neck and
her hands and her knees, too, but she decided to let
her feet go until after dinner. Then she opened her
suitcase (really Jacqueline’s!) and feeling a little
apologetic, even though it was Jacqueline’s own plan
that she was carrying out, she took Jacqueline’s
pretty blue leather traveling-case, with its ivory
implements, and she made her hair smooth and her
hands tidy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline, you see, was a gentle little girl, and
in the haphazard months at Cousin Delia’s she
had not forgotten the careful teachings of her gentle
little mother. If she had, her whole story might have
turned out very differently. She made herself now
as fresh and tidy as possible. Then she sat down
in the low rocker beside the bookcase, and looked at
the books—such a lot of books, not new ones, she
could see, but new to her, bound volumes of St.
Nicholas, and a whole set of Miss Alcott, books
by Laura E. Richards, and Miss Molesworth, Kate
Douglas Wiggin, and Juliana Ewing.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was dipping into “We and the World” when
she heard a knock at her door, and there on the
threshold, not waiting to be asked in, stood Cousin
Penelope. Now that her hat was off, Caroline saw
that she had pretty, fair hair, but she had also a
forehead so high and white that it gave her rather
a forbidding look.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Day-dreaming, Jacqueline?” said Cousin Penelope
briskly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I was looking at the books,” Caroline explained,
as she rose hastily. “I never saw so many.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Penelope pursed her lips. To herself she said
that she must mention to her mother that “Aunt
Edie” was evidently an outdoor sort, without any
claim to culture. Didn’t it prove the point, when
Cousin Jack’s poor little daughter was so unused
to books that she was quite excited over three shelves
of old-fashioned, shabby juveniles?</p>

<p class='c009'>But to Caroline, Penelope merely said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Those were my books, Jacqueline, when I was
your age. Your father and I often read them together
on rainy days. You’ll have plenty of time
to read them this summer; but you must come now,
for dinner will be waiting.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Penelope spoke crisply, coolly, and her tone made
something inside Caroline curl up tight, like a sea-anemone
when you touch it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cousin Penelope doesn’t like me,” she told
herself.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />MUSIC IN THE TWILIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In Cousin Penelope’s wake, for she did not quite
dare to walk at her side, as she had walked with
Aunt Eunice, Caroline went down to the dining
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>To feel as she felt on entering that cool, orderly
room, with its white paint and dark paper, its old
portraits and its severe, highly polished dark furniture,
you would need to have lived for six months
with Cousin Delia, whose dining room furniture
was all of golden oak, carved in endless curves and
curlicues, and who kept a piece of fly-paper on the
golden oak sideboard, between the blue glass lemonade
set and the plated silver cake dish.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a sense almost of going to church, Caroline
slipped into the place at the table to which Aunt
Eunice smilingly motioned her. There was no cloth
on the table, just drawn-work doilies of sheer white
linen, and on the largest doily in the center was a
crystal bowl with pale small roses. The glasses
were almost as thin as soap-bubbles, and the silver
was thin, and highly polished, and plain. All this
Caroline had noted in the first instant, and in the
second she noted with relief that there was no butler
after all, only the good-humored maid, Sallie.
Then she took courage, and decided that, even
though there were several knives and forks and
spoons at her place, she would be all right if she
began at each end and worked inward.</p>

<p class='c009'>Probably in all her life Caroline had never eaten
a meal that tasted so good as that first dinner at The
Chimnies. There was a clear, well-flavored soup,
in a deep plate covered with Chinese figures in lettuce
green and raspberry pink. With the soup were
little golden-hued dice which were like glorified
bread crumbs. Then there were slices of pink ham,
with fat as white as marble, amber brown balls of
potato, delicate small peas, a crisp salad of lettuce
and ice cold cucumber, with pale, firm cheese and
salty toasted crackers, and last of all little tarts of
fresh strawberries, topped with whipped cream.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline ate, silently and earnestly. She had eaten
her last three meals, remember, out of a shoe box.</p>

<p class='c009'>Very early, with the soup, Aunt Eunice asked her
if she would like a glass of milk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, please, thank you,” said Caroline, “if it
isn’t too much trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After that, conversation so far as concerned Caroline,
ceased to exist. She ate, and was glad that
no one noticed her, or so she thought. But someone
must have noticed her, it seemed. For when
Caroline was half through her little tart, eating
in careful small bites, as her mother had taught
her, and holding her fork nicely, Cousin Penelope
spoke out of a clear sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She really favors our side of the family, doesn’t
she, Mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jacqueline?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. The resemblance is striking. Just look at
Great-aunt Joanna Gildersleeve.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For the life of her Caroline couldn’t help looking
round, in the direction in which Aunt Eunice
and Cousin Penelope both were looking. She half
expected to see another great-aunt standing right
at her elbow. But instead she only saw, hanging
upon the wall above the sideboard, the portrait of
a rather forbidding lady in a cap, with a curtain
parting on a landscape just behind her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t quite see the likeness,” murmured Aunt
Eunice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s something in the inner curve of the eyebrow
and the set of the nostrils,” Cousin Penelope explained
patiently. “It’s almost indefinable but quite
unmistakable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice did not dispute the point. Neither,
you may be sure, did Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>When dinner was over they went into a large,
square room that opened off the dining room. All
round the room were shelves of books in many-colored
bindings, and there was a great writing-table
across the western window. There was a fireplace,
masked with an old-fashioned fire-screen on which
a landscape was worked in faded silks, and above
the fireplace was a marble mantel on which were a
pair of bronze vases. But there was no piano!</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline sat down in a low chair, which Aunt
Eunice recommended to her, and wished that she
had Mildred in her arms. She began to feel very
much alone, with these people who were really not
her people, and a little bit frightened. Older folk
than Caroline have felt that way, in a strange place,
among strange faces, with the day ending, and no
way of knowing what the next day may bring.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sallie brought in a tray, with matches and a spirit-lamp,
a canister that savored of rich coffee-berries,
a little glass coffee machine, half filled with crystal
clear hot water, two cups, thin as egg-shells, and
small almost as eggs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice put the machine together, measured
the coffee, as if she performed a religious ceremony,
and set the lamp beneath the globe of water.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course you don’t take coffee, my dear,” she
spoke kindly to Caroline. “Go look in the drawer
of the table over there. I think you’ll find a box of
candied ginger. Help yourself!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline took courage, as she saw Aunt Eunice
smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you don’t mind,” she whispered, “I’d rather—<i>have</i>
you a piano?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She felt that Cousin Penelope, cool and aloof in
her chair by the window, looked at her, surprised
and not altogether pleased.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, dear,” said Aunt Eunice readily.
“Right across the hall in the long parlor. You can
find your way?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes,” Caroline nodded hastily.</p>

<p class='c009'>She wanted to get to the piano quickly, before
Cousin Penelope interfered. For she felt that
Cousin Penelope was sitting up very straight and
about to speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Run along!” said Aunt Eunice. Did she, too,
feel that Penelope was rising to remark?</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline “ran along.” She went so fast that she
was almost out of earshot when Penelope expressed
herself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother! That child—strumming on my
piano!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She won’t hurt the piano fatally, my dear,” said
Aunt Eunice, placidly but with unexpected firmness.
“Poor little shy thing! She’s lonely and homesick,
as any one can see, and if the piano gives her pleasure
to-night, who would begrudge it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>No one, evidently, while Aunt Eunice was around.
Penelope sank back in her chair, but there was a
little crease, not at all becoming, in her high white
forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meantime Caroline had “found her way,” easily
enough, across the hall and into the long parlor,
which was as long as the book room and the dining
room put together. Such a big room, with pictures
that frowned on her through the twilight that
was deepening, here on the east side of the house.
But neither the bigness of the room, nor the dimness
of it could daunt Caroline, for at the farther
end she saw the polished bulk of a grand piano.</p>

<p class='c009'>She flew to it across the dark polished floor and
the dusky rugs. There had been no piano at Cousin
Delia’s, only a talking machine. Cousin Delia liked
a fox trot or a coon song as well as the next one.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline sat down on the piano bench. She
poised her hands for a second over the white keys,
almost afraid to touch them lest they melt away and
vanish. Then very softly but firmly she struck a
chord, and another, and another. How the piano
sang in its deep, golden throat! Such a piano as
her precious Muzzy had dreamed of having some
time for their very own! Caroline struck more
chords, and ran a scale to limber her little fingers,
which had grown the least bit stiff with lack of
exercise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The dear little thing!” cooed Aunt Eunice over
her coffee machine. “If she isn’t practicing her
scales.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She cast an appealing look at Penelope, but
Penelope in the window looked unplacated.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline found the pedals with her feet. She
could just reach them. She could make the piano
talk, now loud, now low. She played very softly a
lullaby that her mother had made up, just for her—a
very simple thing—one of the first that she had
ever learned. The stiffness was going from her
fingers. She and this beautiful, wonder working,
deep throated piano were friends. She began to
play the last thing that her mother had taught her,
a rhapsody of Brahms.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the library Aunt Eunice paused in her placid
sipping of her coffee, and looked amazed, for
Penelope had sat up in her chair, with a quick, passionate
movement that was not like Penelope.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother!” There was something like awe in
Penelope’s voice. “That child can play.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite so, dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it isn’t parrot-playing, Mother—there’s
more than her funny little bit of ragged technique—there’s
feeling—listen now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>They listened, while their coffee cooled. Full,
round golden notes sang through the old dim house,
now loud, now low. Night winds blew—bells tolled—echoes
wakened in a vast cathedral aisle beneath a
myriad jewel-like stained windows.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Penelope! Don’t!” Aunt Eunice soothed
suddenly, as if the Penelope who swallowed her
hard sobs was again a little child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t help it, Mother. Don’t you see? There
<i>is</i> something after all in the power of the soul.
That Delane woman—that horsy, tangoing California
girl——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Penelope!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s dead, I know. I shouldn’t speak like that.
But she had no music in her, and Jack hadn’t a note
of it. But I—I——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jack was my favorite cousin,” Penelope whispered.
“You know how much I cared for him.
Even when that Delane girl took him away. And
now Jack’s child—my music is in her—and by that
much she’s mine, not hers,—she’s mine!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c010'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />PENELOPE UNBENDS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Caroline went up to bed at half past eight
in a happy daze. She had played for ever
so long in the parlor that at last was quite dark,
Liszt and Brahms, simple arrangements, of course,
which her mother had selected for her and then she
had improvised rapturously, enjoying that piano as
a man who has gone thirsty for hours in the heat
may enjoy (too weak a word!) a draft of cool
water.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last Aunt Eunice had come and turned on the
lights and told her it was bed time. Was she afraid
to go to bed alone?</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline smiled vaguely and said: “No!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then with Aunt Eunice’s kiss on her cheek, she
went up the stairs to her wonderful room. She
found a shaded electric light turned on, the bedcover
folded, the bedclothes turned down. A fresh
nightgown from the suitcase lay on the bed, and
the blue leather traveling-case was on the dressing-table.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline undressed Mildred and put her in the
fresh white bed. Oh, such a contrast that bed was
to the stuffy berth on the train, and the rumpled
bed with the thin mattress, all in lumps, that she had
shared with the oldest baby (fat and a terrible
crowder!) at Cousin Delia’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she went into the spick and span bathroom,
and drew her own bath—all the hot water she
wanted. At Cousin Delia’s the hot water supply
had had a bad trick of giving out after the four
babies were bathed and before it came Caroline’s
turn. But here there was hot water and cold water
and three kinds of soap. Caroline bathed luxuriously,
and dried herself on one of the huge soft
towels and slipped on the fresh nightgown (Jacqueline’s
nightgown!). Then she faced a problem
that had worried her, off and on, for the last half
hour.</p>

<p class='c009'>Toothbrush!</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course the one in the blue leather traveling-case
was Jacqueline’s. But to go to bed without washing
one’s teeth seemed to Caroline impossible. She
decided to look in the medicine closet. Perhaps
she would find in it some sort of mouth-wash that
would help her through the night, and then next
day, with the money that was left in Jacqueline’s
purse, she would buy a toothbrush.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were all sorts of things in that Mother
Robinson’s bag of a medicine closet; several kinds
of fresh smelling soap in paper wrappers, rolls of
cotton, bottles of sweet oil and mouth-wash, boracic
acid and toilet-water. There were rolls of adhesive
and jars of cold cream, papers of pins and crystal
clear eye cups. There were also a couple of toothbrushes
sealed in transparent paper cases.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline looked and longed. At last she took one
of the sealed brushes in her hand and went to
the door that was opposite the door into her own
room. Sallie had said something about this door’s
opening into some one’s else room, and she must
always leave it unlocked, when she went out of the
bathroom.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline knocked at the door. She hoped that
Aunt Eunice would open to her, but instead it was
Cousin Penelope in a loose lacy gown, who appeared
on the threshold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry,” faltered Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No matter,” said Penelope, coolly but not unkindly.
“I was only reading a silly book. What is
it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Could I—could I have this toothbrush?” hesitated
Caroline. She felt guiltily that she must make
some explanation, so she added: “I don’t want to
use the one—the one I brought off the train.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re like me,” said Penelope, as if she were
pleased with the resemblance. “I always want to
throw away everything that I’ve used in the dirty
cars. Of course, take the toothbrush, Jacqueline.
Take anything you wish from the medicine closet.
My own personal things I keep on my dressing-table.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you very much,” said Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>She stood there, shy and solemn, in the little
short-sleeved, square-necked nightgown. She hardly
knew whether to turn away or to linger. Because
Cousin Penelope did not turn away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope seemed trying to speak, and apparently
she did not find it easy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jacqueline,” she brought out the words suddenly,
“how long have you—taken lessons on the piano?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Always,” said Caroline truthfully, “except last
winter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course,” the thought flashed through Penelope’s
mind, “they neglected her music at that horrid
school where Edith Delane sent her—to get rid
of her.” But what she said aloud to Caroline was:
“Who taught you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>No doubt Caroline ought to have said, “My
mother,” and betrayed the whole deception that
Jacqueline had led her into practicing. But it takes
courage to destroy a lovely world in which, however
undeservedly, one is very happy, especially when
the destruction of that world would leave one cowering,
a guilty wretch, before such a judge as Cousin
Penelope, with her serene, high forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A—a lady taught me,” Caroline told a half-truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She must have been quite a good teacher.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline nodded. The tears were near her eyelids.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Folks called her a very good teacher,” she whispered.
“She’s dead now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Loyal and affectionate,” thought Penelope.
“That’s the Gildersleeve blood in her.” Aloud she
went on, with a change of subject, to Caroline’s great
relief: “There’s a Polish lady spending the summer
here in Longmeadow. She’s a really exceptional
pianist. I believe if I asked her——How would
you like to have some lessons from her this summer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline clasped her hands upon the toothbrush.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I’d love it like anything—but I—I couldn’t—it—it
would cost—lots.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Penelope lifted her brows slightly, but she
smiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That sounds like Great-uncle Thaddeus Gildersleeve,
who was the most cautious man in Longmeadow,”
she said. “Don’t fret about the bills!
This will be my treat, Jacqueline, to my Cousin
Jack’s little daughter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She did not offer to kiss Caroline, but she put her
hand on her shoulder, and smiled down at her quite
kindly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Run along to bed now,” she said. “We’ll go
together and call on Madame Woleski to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A little later, when Caroline was settled between
the fresh, cool sheets in the green and golden room,
she told it all to Mildred.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m to take lessons from a Polish lady,” she
whispered. “Oh, I think Cousin Penelope likes me,
or she wouldn’t have offered. It’s like Heaven here,
isn’t it, Mildred? If only we could stay forever!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And while she whispered the words, Caroline was
aware that she meant to stay just as long as ever she
could. Any vague scruple of conscience which might
have driven her to confess to the deluded Gildersleeves,
was now quite done away with. Jacqueline,
inventor of the deed, had told her to keep still,
and as long as the reward of silence was to live in
this wonderful house with a piano, and take lessons
from an exceptional Polish lady, she would keep
still. She only hoped and prayed that Jacqueline
might not find it too terrible with the cows
and half-aunt Martha, and so be moved to come
at once and claim her rightful place.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c010'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />THE CAPTURE OF A HALF-AUNT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When Caroline walked out of the drawing-room
on the train, in the wake of the black
porter, you will remember that she left Jacqueline
in the patched brown and white gingham (Caroline’s
dress!) restrapping the shabby suitcase (Caroline’s
suitcase!).</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline was not in the least flustered. Through
the open door of the drawing-room she could see
that a stout man with a bag, and several other passengers
were making their way toward the open
vestibule. She had a couple of minutes to spare.
And she fully meant to be the last person to leave
the train at Baring Junction. She wasn’t going to
cloud the issue and spoil her little plot by having
the groups of waiting relatives see two little brown-eyed
girls, with bobbed brown hair, descend in a
procession from the train.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline felt pretty sure—and the event justified
her—that when a nicely dressed little girl, with
J. G. on her smart suitcase and her hatbox, came
timidly down the steps of the car, the Gildersleeve
relatives would pounce upon her and bear her away.
Then later, when Caroline’s shabby little substitute
appeared, she would naturally fall to the share of
half-aunt Martha.</p>

<p class='c009'>So at the latest moment she dared to risk, Jacqueline
took the red sweater over her arm and the
big suitcase in her hand, and trailed along at the end
of the line that was leaving the car. She felt very
jubilant, for she loved to play-act—and this was
the most perfect piece of play-acting that she had
ever invented. She wasn’t in the least afraid for, if
she found half-aunt Martha horrid and her house
impossible, she would simply go to her Gildersleeve
relatives and explain who she was, and ask Caroline
to back up her story, and then she would have back
her own clothes and her own rightful place, and
everything would be just as it was before.</p>

<p class='c009'>A little hard on Caroline, perhaps, but still, she
would be no worse off than she would have been, if
she hadn’t met Jacqueline in the first place. At
least she would have had the society of the piano—why
should any one yearn for a piano?—for several
days.</p>

<p class='c009'>You see, Jacqueline was a selfish little girl, and a
thoughtless little girl. But perhaps young Aunt
Edith Delane, who now was Edith Knowlton, hadn’t
been the wisest of foster-mothers. In some things
she had indulged Jacqueline foolishly, and in others
she had checked her with equal folly. Jacqueline
had had lovely clothes and toys and all manner of
semi grown-up pleasures, but she had not been allowed
to make friends when and where she pleased,
nor do the foolish “rowdy” things, as Aunt Edith
called them, that she had seen other children do—such
as riding their bicycles through the streets to
public school or flying hazardously down hill on
rollerskates. Of course Jacqueline had longed to do
the very things that she was forbidden to do. And
now she could. She was rid of Aunt Edith, and
governesses, and teachers, and chaperons. She
was just Caroline Tait, and she was going to have
the free, untrammeled time of her young life—always
with the Gildersleeves to shield her in the
background!</p>

<p class='c009'>Staggering under her suitcase, Jacqueline reached
the head of the steps. In the distance she caught
just a glimpse of Caroline in the henna-colored frock
being hurried off to a tiresome old limousine by a
prim-looking lady in a mauve silk sweater. Thank
goodness, she wasn’t Caroline! She knew just the
sort of dull old poky house they’d take her to.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Jacqueline gave her attention to getting herself
and the suitcase, with the porter’s help, down the
steps of the car. She landed in a little knot of
people who were kissing their friends and sorting
out their hand-luggage, and she saw a woman hurrying
toward her, a solidly-built woman with a
weather-beaten face, who wore an old black skirt
and a white shirt-waist, and a black straw sailor-hat,
a little askew. The woman began to smile as
soon as her eyes met Jacqueline’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline play-acted all over the place. She
dropped the suitcase and fairly flew to meet the
stranger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, half-aunt Martha,” she cried loudly, and
cast herself into the woman’s arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My goodness, child,” said Mrs. Martha Conway.
“Don’t knock the breath out of a body!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She kissed Jacqueline soundly on the cheek.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I kind of suspect you’re Caroline,” she said, with
a twinkle in her gray eyes. “Give me hold of that
suitcase. I’d have had one of the boys here to
help us—they were all crazy to come meet their
cousin—but I wanted room in the car so as to get
your trunk, and I just brought Nellie along.”</p>

<p class='c009'>All the while she talked, half-aunt Martha had
been hurrying along the station platform, and hurrying
Jacqueline and the suitcase with her, much as the
Red Queen hurried Alice in the Looking Glass
Country, you will remember. They now turned
a corner of the station, and there in the shade opposite
the open door of the baggage room stood
a dingy-looking Ford. In the Ford was a sun-browned
little girl of six in a stiffly starched gingham
dress, who smiled and waved her hand to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You keep on sitting, Nellie,” called Aunt Martha.
“Where’s your trunk-check, Caroline?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gee! I forgot all about it,” said Jacqueline ruefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can’t have,” Aunt Martha told her, patiently
but firmly. “Look in your pockets—in your
sweater pocket.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It isn’t there,” Jacqueline confessed. She
hardly knew whether to laugh at herself or be annoyed.
She looked at Aunt Martha’s anxious face,
and decided she wouldn’t laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll unstrap the suitcase,” said Aunt Martha,
as she placed the suitcase on a packing-box. “Don’t
worry, Caroline. It must be somewhere. I knew a
woman once that always kept her trunk-check in the
toe of her bedshoe when she went on a long train
trip. And even if we don’t find it, we can prove
property and claim your trunk. What kind of a
trunk was it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I don’t know,” said Jacqueline feebly. She
could feel her cheeks burning, and the tears of vexation
rising to her eyes. For she fully believed that
everything was going to be spoiled right at the outset.
And somehow, as she looked at Aunt Martha’s
weather-beaten anxious face and steady gray eyes,
she felt that it would not be what she would call a
picnic to explain to Aunt Martha why she didn’t
know what her own trunk looked like, and how
she came to stand here in the soiled white shoes of
Caroline Tait.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Martha Conway saw in Jacqueline’s confusion
only the natural distress of a child, who was
tired with a long journey and frightened at the prospect
of losing all her little possessions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t cry!” she bade briskly. “’Twon’t help
matters. Nothing’s lost, if you know where ’tis, as
the sea-cook said when he dropped the tea-kettle
overboard, and that check must just be in this suitcase
somewheres.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She had the straps unfastened by this time and
the lid lifted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My, what a hoorah’s nest!” she murmured, and
indeed Jacqueline’s hasty incursion into the suitcase,
in search of Mildred’s wardrobe, had utterly disarranged
Caroline’s neat garments.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha turned over the pink and white
soiled gingham and the discarded underwear. She
felt in the toe of each of the worn bedshoes, and
looked disappointed at finding nothing in them. She
shook out the nightgown. But though she looked
more and more anxious, and though her silence made
Jacqueline feel more and more what a real disaster
to Caroline and to Caroline’s people the loss
of a mere trunk would be, she did not once scold.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the bottom of the suitcase were Caroline’s
comb and brush, in a chintz case with the initials
F. T. worked on it in cross-stitch, and a little chintz
handkerchief-case, with the same initials. Aunt
Martha opened the handkerchief-case and smiled
with relief as she saw on top of the handkerchiefs
the clumsy oblong of the pasteboard trunk-check.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, now,” she said, “you were a good girl to
put it away so carefully, only next time don’t go and
forget where you put it. Now I’ll go right and get
the baggage man to put the trunk into the Ford. I
suppose there’ll be room. Or did you bring a Saratoga,
Caroline?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The trunk isn’t exactly what you might call
big,” murmured Jacqueline non-committally. She
certainly hoped it wasn’t. What mightn’t it be like,
this unknown trunk of Caroline’s that was now her
trunk?</p>

<p class='c009'>While she waited for Aunt Martha to return with
the trunk, Jacqueline started to restrap the suitcase,
but before she did so, she cast a hurried glance
about, in search of the trunk-key. She was pretty
sure that Aunt Martha would be asking for that,
next. To her great relief, she found underneath
the comb and brush case a shabby little red purse
(Caroline’s purse!) and in it were the trunk-key,
two pennies, and a fifty-cent piece. She pocketed
the purse and its contents joyfully. Fair exchange
was no robbery, and even after the porter had his
fee, there were left a couple of dollars in the vanity bag
(Jacqueline’s bag!) that Caroline had carried
away.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time the suitcase was strapped, Aunt Martha
came back with a man in shirt-sleeves who
carried a trunk on his shoulder. Not at all a large
trunk, praise be! but a little battered steamer-trunk,
which went quite easily between the back and front
seats of the Ford, with room enough besides for
the suitcase, and Jacqueline’s red sweater, and some
brown paper bundles and bags that were half-aunt
Martha’s. One didn’t come to Baring Junction
every day, it seemed, and one profited by the occasion
to do a little shopping.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the baggage was safely placed, Aunt Martha
and Jacqueline settled themselves on the front
seat, with the six-year-old girl between them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is Nellie,” said Aunt Martha, “and this is
your Cousin Caroline, Nellie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The little girl hung her head and smiled. She
had a pointed chin and thick golden brown eyelashes.
She seemed to Jacqueline rather a baby.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a little rebellion on the part of the Ford,
which Aunt Martha subdued in a capable manner,
the car got under way. Jacqueline watched the process
with interest. She knew a lot of funny stories
about Fords, but she had never ridden in one before.
Uncle Jimmie had a Locomobile, and Aunt Edie
swore by her Marmon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rather spasmodically, as they got up speed, they
rolled across the worn asphalt of the station park
and into the one wide street of Baring Junction.
Along the street were two-story buildings of brick,
fruit shops and hardware shops and drygoods shops,
as the wares that overflowed on the sidewalk bore
witness, and drug shops. At sight of the large advertisements
that shouted the joys of sundaes and
cool drinks, Jacqueline remembered that she was
thirsty. She remembered also the fifty cents in
Caroline’s shabby red purse. She never dreamed
that the gift of fifty cents, because Caroline must
not go on a journey penniless, meant real generosity
on Cousin Delia’s part.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s stop and get a drink,” begged Jacqueline.
“My treat, of course. I’ve got fifty cents—enough
for three fifteen-cent sodas.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha turned her head and looked at her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Forty-five cents just for drinks?” she said. “You
hang on to that half-dollar, Caroline. You’ll be
needing it, like as not, for hair-ribbons.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline started to say, very rudely: “It’s my
money!” But she recollected that it was really
Caroline’s. She also caught herself wondering if
it were advisable to be rude to half-aunt Martha.
A lady who could squelch a Ford might be able to
squelch a supposed half-niece.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she was glad that she hadn’t been rude, for
Aunt Martha smiled. She seemed to guess what it
was like to be ten years old, and just off the train
on a hot June afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll get you and Nellie each an ice-cream cone,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nellie smiled. She couldn’t have looked more
blissfully happy if somebody had promised her a
beautiful fifty-cent special, with a plate of <i>petit
fours</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a nice-looking place,” suggested Jacqueline
eagerly, “the big one with the little fountain
of water in the window.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Donovan’s?” said Aunt Martha. “That’s a
big place, all right, and prices to match. They’ll
charge you fifteen cents for an ice-cream cone if
you go in there. We’ll stop at the little Greek
place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Just at the end of the street of brick buildings
they stopped accordingly at a tiny shop, wedged in
between two pompous neighbors. Aunt Martha
bought two ice-cream cones for seven cents apiece.
Only two cones. Perhaps she didn’t like ice-cream
herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eat ’em up before they melt, and don’t spill any
more than you can help,” she advised.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nellie’s little pink tongue was deep in the custardy
contents of the pasteboard-like cone before
Aunt Martha had regained her seat. Jacqueline
clutched her cone and followed suit joyously. Never
before had she been encouraged to eat dubious ice-cream,
publicly, shamelessly, in a moving car, on an
open road. She licked the cool drops that dribbled
from the melting mound, and thought them delicious.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, half-aunt Martha,” she said, with a
sticky smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha chuckled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My land, child,” she said. “Don’t call me half-aunt.
Makes me feel like I was cut in two.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI' class='c010'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />ON THE ROAD TO LONGMEADOW</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Along the country road, through pastures and
farms and meadows, where the limousine had
smoothly, swiftly glided, Aunt Martha’s Ford
bounced sturdily. Soon the ice-cream cones were
demolished, even to the last gritty crumb of the
cornucopias. Jacqueline wiped her hands and her
face on her handkerchief (Caroline’s handkerchief!).</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wipe off your mouth, Nellie,” bade Aunt Martha.
“Let Caroline do it for you. I haven’t a hand
to spare.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline scrubbed Nellie vigorously with Nellie’s
own pocket handkerchief which had a rabbit
worked in one corner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s my best hanky,” said Nellie, and with
the ice thus broken between them, began to ask
Jacqueline questions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Did she sleep in the train? Did she have a real
bed? Was she scared all alone like that?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course not,” said Jacqueline, rather showily.</p>

<p class='c009'>She stuffed her mussy handkerchief back into her
pocket, and there were the chocolates, salvage of
the satin box. She decided to share them with this
new acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here, Nellie,” she said. “Don’t you like chocolates?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nellie seized upon the proffered sweet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only one, Nellie,” struck in Aunt Martha, who
seemed to know without looking what went on
among the children round her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve got a pocketful,” Jacqueline urged generously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No need to be piggy on that account. Where
did you get ’em, Caroline? I hope you don’t spend
money foolishly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There was a little girl on the train had a whole
box of chocolates.” Jacqueline spoke truthful
words, but with untruthful intent. “These are some
of them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha looked at her disapprovingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s just as well not to pick up acquaintances on
trains,” she said. “But I don’t need to lay down
the law, for you won’t be taking another such journey
for one while.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not unless you send me to an Institution,”
thought Jacqueline. What would it be like to go to
an Institution, she wondered? Perhaps she would
be really bad, and let Aunt Martha send her there.
The Gildersleeves could always come and get her
out.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nellie interrupted Jacqueline’s train of thought.
She had bitten into the plump chocolate she had
chosen and found it not at all to her taste.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is a bad candy,” she protested. “It ought
to be white sugar inside and instead it’s all gooey
gum.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s nice jelly, you goop,” said Jacqueline.
“Throw it away, and have another.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!” Aunt Martha struck in. “You can’t waste
good candy like that, Nellie. If you don’t like
what Caroline gives you, leave it alone. But you
can’t have another. Caroline may want to save a
piece for each of the boys.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed to Jacqueline pathetic that mere candy
should be so precious.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, let Nellie find one that she likes,” she
pleaded, and added, without thinking: “I’ll get
a whole box of candy to-morrow for the boys.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha smiled rather quizzically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a box of that sort of candy, Caroline. It
must have cost at least a dollar a pound. Does seem
sort of wicked to throw money about that way, when
times are so hard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha spoke seriously, and the gray eyes
that she suddenly bent on Jacqueline were very
grave, and even stern. Jacqueline suddenly reconsidered
her plan to be naughty and get sent to an
Institution. There might, she concluded, be unpleasantnesses
before she got there. Not of course
that she was afraid of Aunt Martha!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll keep what’s left of the chocolates for the
boys,” she said quite meekly. “How many of ’em
are there—the boys, I mean, not the chocolates.
I’ve kind of forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No wonder, either,” Aunt Martha answered
heartily. “You can’t have heard much about your
Longmeadow relations. Your mother and I were
only connected by marriage, and both of us busy
women, so correspondence sort of languished after
your father died. Can’t say you favor him in looks.
You must take after your mother’s folks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline blushed with embarrassment. What
fibs might she not yet be forced to tell?</p>

<p class='c009'>“There now,” said Aunt Martha. “I shouldn’t
be personal, setting a bad example to you and Nellie.
Let’s talk about the boys.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s!” said Jacqueline, with heartfelt relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, there’s my big boy, Ralph. He’s most
sixteen, and he’ll go to High School over to Baring
Center next winter, if we can get conveyance.” A
worried look played for a moment on Aunt Martha’s
steady face, and was gone as quickly as it
came. “Ralph is my right hand on the farm,” she
said with a little smile. “Like you must have been
to your mother, Caroline.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline blushed again. She had played several
parts in her life, but she had never adopted
the rôle of right hand to any one. Did grown folk
speak always of children who were right hands with
the sort of smile that was on Aunt Martha’s firm
lips, and that sort of shininess in the eyes?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then there’s Dick,” went on Aunt Martha.
“He’s twelve now, and Neil is ten next month. You
come just between ’em. And here’s Nellie. She’s
a great help to us, too. She sets the table and puts
away the clean dishes, and plays with the babies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nellie smiled, and showed two engaging dimples.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve got nice babies,” she said eagerly. “We
haven’t had ’em long, but they’re going to stay with
us always, aren’t they, Mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re no blood-relation to you, Caroline,”
she explained. “It’s on the other side of the family.
My husband’s sister Grace married a poor fellow
named Pearsall that was dreadful sort of unlucky.
She took sick and died right after little Annie was
born, and he couldn’t rightly seem to do for his
children. So Mother and I—that’s my husband’s
mother, Caroline—we just sent for the babies.
Freddie’s three years old now, and Annie is nineteen
months.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’d ought to see her walk!” cried Nellie.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha smiled rather grimly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Next thing she’ll be walking into everything just
like Freddie does,” she said. “Young ones and
ducks are a good deal alike some ways.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline looked at Aunt Martha for a moment,
while she thought rapidly. At Buena Vista she had
heard her Aunt Edith and her friends sing the
praises of one of their number, who had adopted a
little French orphan. To give a child a home was a
serious undertaking, even for a lady who, like Aunt
Edith’s friend, had a great house and servants and
cars and lovely gowns and jewels. But here was
Aunt Martha, who had no car but a Ford, and wore
tacky old clothes that Aunt Edith’s chambermaid
would have scorned, who scrimped on the price of
an ice-cream cone and thought a dollar a pound for
chocolates (Jacqueline’s really had cost a dollar-fifty!)
sinful waste. Aunt Martha was really <i>poor</i>—yet
<i>she</i> was giving a home to two children—and
now to a third.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aunt Martha,” Jacqueline burst out, in the small-boy
way that she had when she was excited. “I
think you’re awful good to give Caroline Tait a
home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha stared at her, then smiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t talk about yourself as if you were in a
legal document, you funny young one!” she said.
“And as to giving you a home, why, there’s always
room for one more. Besides,” she went on, and
Jacqueline felt dimly the tact and kindness that impelled
her, “we haven’t any <i>big</i> girl to make our
family circle complete, and I know you’ll be a great
help and comfort to us, Caroline.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I’m glad to say that at this moment Jacqueline
felt horribly ashamed of the trick she had played on
Martha Conway.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I guess so,” she mumbled blushingly. “I
hope so. I’ll try, Aunt Martha.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />NEW RELATIONS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Over the covered bridge and into Longmeadow
Street the Ford panted, where the limousine
some time before had silently and sumptuously
rolled. But in Longmeadow Street Jacqueline’s way
parted from Caroline’s. Before they reached the
Gildersleeve place they turned to the left into a
road of trodden dirt. Soon they had left the well-kept
village houses, with their trim lawns and flower-beds,
behind them. They drove now through vast
level fields which were green with the tops of onions.
In the distance were mountains, such as Caroline was
studying from her north window. Overhead the
blue sky was losing some of its hard brilliance, as
the sun jogged downward toward the western hills.</p>

<p class='c009'>Along the dirt road were strung a few farms,
wide apart, with clusters of buildings, houses, barns,
and sheds. Around each farmhouse grew trees,
beeches and elms and nut-trees. But the road itself
was shadeless, running straight as a builder’s line
between the green and pungent-smelling fields of
onions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My, but it’s hot!” panted Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You just wait till winter,” boasted Nellie. “The
wind comes just a-whooping down from the north,
and the snow is that high. Last winter I got in a
drift up to my waist, going to school. Ralph, he
hauls me on my sled but——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell Caroline about the blizzard later,” Aunt
Martha interrupted. “Here we are now, and she’s
got other things to think about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They turned from the road into a dirt track. On
the right was a square old white house, badly in
need of paint, with huge bushes of lilac that hid its
front door from the road, and elms that towered
above the weather-worn dark roof. At the left was
untidy grass where red hens scratched among rusty
croquet wickets; poplar trees, with a shabby hammock
hung between two of them; a swing that
lacked a seat, drooping from a butternut tree. Then
the car stopped in the irregular plot of trodden dirt
at the side-door of the house. A great slab of granite
was the doorstone, and round it grew bachelor’s
buttons and phlox, fenced high with wire to keep
out the chickens.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline noticed that if they drove on, they
would land in a barn, with a wide open door, and
beside the barn was a lane, which ran off toward
the western mountains, and there was an orchard,
and sheds, and a fenced, small cow-yard. She didn’t
have time for more than a fleeting glimpse.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s Grandma, Caroline,” Aunt Martha
claimed her attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline turned her head and saw an old lady
come briskly out upon the doorstone. She was
weather-brown and small and spry, as they say in
New England. She had very dark eyes and a thin,
delicate nose, and she was as neat as wax, in a gray
alpaca dress, and a big white apron. A little tow-headed
boy in blue overalls, who must be Freddie,
came trotting at her side, but as soon as he saw
Jacqueline, he clutched at Grandma’s skirts and hid
his head in their folds.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline opened the door of the Ford and
jumped out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you do, Mrs. Conway,” she began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Guess you’d better say Grandma, and have it
over with,” the old lady said, and kissed her. “My,
but you’re a fine big girl for ten years old—not a
bit spindle-legged like some city children. You
come right in now and wash up while they’re getting
the things out of the car. I got some water
hot on the oil stove.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At Grandma’s side, with Freddie peeping at her
round Grandma’s skirts, Jacqueline went into the
kitchen of the old Conway house. It was a long
room, with many-paneled doors, and windows set
with little lights of glass. On the well-scoured floor
were mats of braided rags. At one side a huge
fireplace had been bricked up, and projecting from
what had been its hearth, stood a big cookstove,
ornamented with polished nickel, which was quite
cold. At the other side of the room, between the
windows, was an iron sink with two pumps, and
near it a big three-burner oil stove, on which a kettle
gently simmered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hard water in the right-hand pump,” Grandma
rapidly explained to Jacqueline. “Cistern water in
the left-hand. Cistern water is good for the complexion—but
that will interest you more a few years
later. There’s the hand basin—don’t ever take the
tin one—it’s for the vegetables. Don’t touch that
yellow soap—leave it for the dishes and such like.
Here’s the white soap for your hands, and you’ll
find the clean roller towel on the closet door.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Why, this was roughing it, thought Jacqueline.
She had known nothing like it since she went camping
in the Yosemite. She washed her face and hands
in a blue enamel basin, with a white lining—soft
water from the left-hand pump, warm water from
the kettle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t waste none of it!” warned Grandma.
“Martha and Nellie and the boys will want a lick
before supper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She dried her face and hands on the clean, coarse
roller towel, and then with great bumping and
thumping her trunk (Caroline’s trunk!) was
brought into the kitchen, and she met Caroline’s
cousins, who had served as baggage smashers. Of
course she knew them at once from their mother’s
description. The tallest one, with the direct gray
eyes like Aunt Martha’s and the cowlick, was Ralph,
and the thin brown one with the big mouth was
Dickie, and the red-head who grinned at her
engagingly was Neil. Ralph wore long pants and
shirt of khaki and heavy shoes and stockings, but
Dickie and Neil were barelegged in sneakers, and
their old shirts and knickers, like their hands, might
have been cleaner. But they looked nice boys, and
even if they hadn’t been, Jacqueline wasn’t in the
least afraid of boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>She shook hands all round, and then Nellie wished
her to look at Annie, the wonderful baby. Off the
kitchen was a little bedroom, which had been Grandma’s
for years and years, and here in a little crib beside
Grandma’s bed with its white dimity cover, sat
Annie. She was a blue-eyed, serious person, in faded
pink rompers, and she divided her attention between
a string of empty spools and her own toes. Jacqueline
felt sorry for her. Poor baby, with so
little to play with! She sat down beside her and
dangled the spools before her eyes. Then the
serious Annie suddenly gurgled and clutched at them
and clapped her hands and laughed, with adorable
dimplings. She was more fun than a kitten. No,
she wasn’t like a kitten. With her firm little body
she was much more like a wriggling, happy, affectionate
small puppy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bring her along, Caroline,” called Grandma,
from the kitchen. “Supper’s ready.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline didn’t know much about babies, but
she wouldn’t admit her ignorance, especially before
Nellie. She picked Annie up in her arms, and holding
her tight—for to drop her would be more
dreadful even than to drop a puppy—she followed Nellie
to the supper table.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline had rather expected that the Conways,
being poor people, would eat in the kitchen, but
she found the table laid in the big square room off
the kitchen that looked into both the side-yard and
the lilac bushes at the front of the house. It was
a shabby room, with faded brown wall-paper and
a painted floor. There was a well-worn couch in
one corner, a wicker armchair, and a couple of
rockers, a sewing machine by the side-window, and
a whatnot in the farthest corner, filled with school
books and farm papers. The table was spread with
a checkered red and white cloth, and the dishes were
of three or four different patterns. The silver was
plated, and the glasses were thick. But the table
was neatly set, Jacqueline realized, and everything
was spotlessly clean.</p>

<p class='c009'>Annie sat in a highchair beside Aunt Martha,
and Freddie sat on a hassock placed on a chair at
Grandma’s right hand. Jacqueline sat between
Grandma and Dickie. It was Aunt Martha, of
course, who brought in the supper. Such a supper
Jacqueline had never heard tell of—a huge shortcake,
made of two layers of biscuit-dough that must
have been baked in the grandfather of all drip
pans. Luscious red strawberries, crushed to a pulp
and mixed with sugar, were between the layers and
oozed their richness, as Aunt Martha cut great
squares for her hungry family. Besides the
shortcake there was milk for the children, and tea in thin
white cups, adorned with jocund green dragons,
for Grandma and Aunt Martha. That was all the
supper.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline looked questioningly round her. Was
there nothing else to begin with—or to end with?
But her cousins (Caroline’s cousins!) were wading
into the shortcake, as if it were all that they asked or
expected. She took a bite—a large one. Oh, but
she found it good!</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked sidewise at Dickie, and Dickie, with
his mouth full, looked at her. She nodded toward
the juicy piece of shortcake on the platter that was
all ready and waiting for the first child who should
ask for a second helping.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bet you I’ll beat you to it,” murmured Jacqueline.
Instinct told her that invasions of decorum
had best not be shouted aloud in Aunt Martha’s
presence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“G’on!” said Dickie softly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />“CALL ME JACKIE!”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Strawberry shortcake is a bond in common.
By the time that supper was over Jacqueline
was no longer a stranger to Caroline’s cousins, and
when she had shared with them the rather squashy
chocolates that still survived in her pockets, they
were friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish you’d call me Jackie,” she told them.
“That’s what they always called me at school.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t take much stock in nicknames,” said
Aunt Martha. She had such an uncanny way of always
being there, although you couldn’t say she
snooped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d feel more at home if you called me Jackie,”
Jacqueline suggested artfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>To that plea Aunt Martha yielded, as Jacqueline
had guessed she would.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, then—Jackie. Now you can unpack
your trunk. That’ll be chore enough for to-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But after this Jackie can do the dishes,” suggested
Neil teazingly, “because she’s a girl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir,” said Aunt Martha promptly, “you
can keep right on doing your share of dishes, because
you’re a boy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Unpacking the trunk was really chore enough,
Jacqueline decided, before she was through. To
take even a steamer-trunk up the steep stairs that
led from the kitchen was impossible. All Caroline’s
possessions had to go in armsful (Jacqueline’s
arms!) to the room that she was to share with
Nellie.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a square room—Nellie thought it a large
room—with a bricked up fireplace and a narrow
white wood mantel, on which were a china dog, with
a basket of matches in his mouth, and a little figure
of a boy in a short tunic, kneeling at his prayers.
On the walls was a paper strewn with baskets of
roses. Unfortunately the paper had been hung upside
down, which gave the room a somewhat rakish
atmosphere. There were only two pictures, an engraving
of a dog, after Landseer, and a resigned-looking
Evangeline seated beside a grave. The
floor was covered with matting, and there were rag
rugs over the thinnest places where the boards
showed through. The bed was high and old-fashioned,
with a chintz valance. The bureau and
the washstand were of black walnut, with marble
tops. The chairs were of painted wood, with
slatted backs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline could claim for her own two drawers
of the bureau, and most of the hooks in the shallow
closet, and as no one offered to arrange her
things for her, she arranged them herself and took
a certain pride in doing so. Only there were so few
things in Caroline’s battered trunk; socks for summer
and stockings for winter, faded and much
darned; undergarments, thinned with frequent washing
and set with neat patches; skimpy-looking gingham
dresses; one dress of wool that had been dyed;
a winter coat, with a collar of worn velvet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Try on that coat, Jackie,” bade Aunt Martha,
as she turned from straining the milk.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline tried it on, and felt that she looked
indeed the part of poor child. Such a shabby, outgrown
little coat it was. Wasn’t she glad that she
was only playing at being Caroline?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tut, tut!” clucked Aunt Martha, and frowned.
“You must have had that coat at least two seasons.
Well, Nellie will grow to it in another year, and
we’ve got to get you a new coat for winter, somehow.
There’s an old ulster of mine perhaps I could
dye and cut over for you. But winter’s some ways
off, and we won’t go crossing bridges till we get to
’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Near the bottom of the trunk Jacqueline discovered
three pairs of Peggy Janes—overalls such
as Aunt Edie would have shrieked aloud to see her
wear. She made up her mind to wear them, here at
the farm. Maybe she would go barefoot, too—or
at least barelegged and in sneakers, like Dickie and
Neil.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the last armful that Jacqueline carried upstairs
was a box of Japanese lacquer, tied with an old
hair-ribbon. Jacqueline had the curiosity to open
it when she was in her room and Nellie’s. Then
she wished that she hadn’t. She felt as if she had
walked into a room without knocking. There were
in the box a few letters, tied up with a bit of worsted,
and slipped upon the worsted, and secured with a
knot, was a plain gold ring. There were two little
pins—not a child’s pins—and a slender chain of
gold beads. There was a little pair of scissors, and
a bag of crocheted purple silk, which held two
spools of fine cotton. There was a tiny fine handkerchief,
with the letter C half finished in the corner,
and the threaded needle stuck in the place, just as
some one had left it. Last of all, wrapped in a
piece of white tissue paper, was a small photograph
of a lady with gentle eyes and a sweet mouth, like
Caroline’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>Very soberly Jacqueline put back everything as
she had found it, and tied up the box, and hid it
away in the back of the drawer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Those were Caroline’s mother’s things,” she
thought, “and she’s dead. I won’t touch ’em again,
ever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By now it was dusky in the little room, as the
long June day came to an end. Aunt Martha
trudged up the stair, with a well-trimmed oil lamp
in her hand. Behind her lagged Freddie and Nellie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll get ’em to bed,” she told Jacqueline. “Freddie
sleeps in my room, just across the hall. You
go sit in the hammock with the boys. By the time
I’m through up here the water will be ready for
you to have a bath, and I guess after that long hot
journey, you’ll be ready for it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Jacqueline sat out in the shabby hammock
under the poplars, in the warm, sweet dusk, and saw
the great June stars come out and the distant mountains
subside into rims of inky blackness round the
silent meadows. She and Neil and Dickie poked
and crowded each other fraternally, and Dickie
boasted about his hunting trips on the mountain with
Ralph, and Jacqueline raged inwardly because, in
her part of Caroline, she couldn’t cap his stories
with her account of the Yosemite.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last Aunt Martha called her into the kitchen.
There were two kettles on the oil stove, and a big
bath towel, worn rather thin, lay over the back of a
chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s the washroom,” Aunt Martha told Jacqueline,
and nodded toward a door at the farther
end of the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline went in. Here were no nickel faucets
and no porcelain bath, but just a stationary tub of
shiny zinc, which drained into a pipe that led out of
doors. A square, unglazed window, high in the
wall, admitted the light from the kitchen, and the
heat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, what a funny bath!” cried Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Tisn’t much like what you’re used to in the
city,” said Aunt Martha, as she bustled in with a
kettle of steaming water. “But I tell you it seems
like Heaven not to have to lug water both ways.
I guess if them that say ‘cleanliness is next to godliness’
had had to winter it once in New England with
four young ones, they’d have said cleanliness was
next thing to martyrdom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Two kettles full of hot water went into the tub,
and a bucket of cold water that Jacqueline pumped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By Saturday night I guess you can do for yourself,
same as Neil,” Aunt Martha told her approvingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Last of all, into the zinc tub one-third full of
warm water, went Jacqueline, and soaped and
splashed and chuckled and enjoyed herself. A funny
bath, indeed! If she had to do it all her life, horrible!
But just for two or three days—why, it
was a lark.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not such a lark though, scrubbing that
zinc tub afterward, with a rag and warm water and
“Clean-o.” She hadn’t thought of doing it, till
Aunt Martha came in and pointed out that cleaning
the tub after you used it had something to do
with the Golden Rule.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know you won’t need to be told twice,” said
Aunt Martha.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess I won’t be here to be told twice,” Jacqueline
thought resentfully as she scrubbed.</p>

<p class='c009'>She came out of the washroom, glowing and glowering,
in Caroline’s nightgown and faded kimono
and worn bedshoes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can brush your teeth upstairs,” said Aunt
Martha, who seemed to find endless last tasks to
do in that kitchen, before she should join Grandma
with the darning basket, under the big, hot lamp
in the dining room. “The hard water for your teeth
is in the little pitcher on the washstand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I——” Jacqueline faced the same difficulty
that at about this hour presented itself to Caroline.
“You see—I haven’t got the toothbrush I had on
the train. I must have—lost it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tut, tut!” Aunt Martha clucked again. Then
she took heart. “It might have been worse. Better
lose your toothbrush than your sweater or your
head, for that matter. You’ll have to buy you a
new one to-morrow. Lucky you didn’t spend that
half-dollar on foolishness. I’ll mix some cooking
salt and warm water, and you just rinse your mouth
out good. It’s the best we can do for now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Left to herself, Jacqueline would probably have
“forgotten” to use the tepid salt and water. But
she was not left to herself. Aunt Martha went upstairs
with her, and stood over her till the mouthwash
was properly and thoroughly applied. Then
she tucked her into bed beside Nellie, who grunted
sleepily and grudgingly moved over to give the newcomer
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having tucked Jacqueline in, Aunt Martha kissed
her in a businesslike and somewhat absent-minded
way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have a good sleep,” she bade, and took the
lamp, and went creaking down the stair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline lay in the dark, beneath the sheet, in
the room that was warm and breathless. She
thought of the zinc tub that she had had to scrub,
and the dishes that she should have to wash, and
of Aunt Martha, who seemed to have as many rules
and standards as if she had dressed in silk and ridden
in a limousine, like Great-aunt Eunice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t like it here,” thought Jacqueline. “First
thing in the morning I’ll hunt up those Gildersleeves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nellie beside her turned sleepily and cooed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“That you, Jackie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nice Jackie—kiss me goo’ night!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline did so. What a hot little thing Nellie
was—but how cunning! That funny baby, too, was
a darling, and Freddie, who gurgled when you
tickled him. Neil had promised to show her a
woodchuck’s hole in the morning, and Dickie had
boasted about his rabbits.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It might be worse,” Jacqueline reconsidered,
“and if I back out, I’ll never get another chance
to wear Peggy Janes, and cut on behind carts, and
be poor and rowdy. I guess now I’m in, I’d better
stick it out for a day or two.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c010'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />THE END OF A PERFECT DAY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When Caroline woke in the morning, she
was surprised to find herself still in the
green and golden room with the bookshelves. She
had rather expected to find that the house with
the dim, cool rooms, and the songful piano, the
white and nickel bath and the ladies (not her relatives!)
who were so kind and friendly, were all
alike the fancies of a dream, and that she was back
in Cousin Delia’s close little stuffy house, with
the smell of frizzled breakfast ham wafting up
from the kitchen, and the eldest baby clamoring to
be dressed at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the room, she found, was real, and the bath
was real. She could almost believe that she was
<i>really</i> Jacqueline. She only wished she were!</p>

<p class='c009'>She dressed herself in the henna-colored frock,
and she dressed Mildred very carefully, in a little
white muslin with pink sprays, most becoming to
Mildred’s blond beauty. Then she opened her bed
to air, and sat down by the window, where she could
watch the mountain. In the morning light it was
quite different from the mountain of yesterday afternoon.
The green of the trees and the red of the
exposed sandstone were very sharp in the strong
sunlight, and gave the huge pile a spick and span
look, as if it had made itself fine for the summer
day.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had put on the little watch which was Jacqueline’s,
though it seemed almost too nice to wear
every day, and the little watch said that it was half
past eight, when there came a knock at the door.
Caroline flew to open it, and there stood Aunt
Eunice, in a cool gray and white lawn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good morning, Aunt Eunice!” cried Caroline.
“Oh, how nice you look!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She reflected then that perhaps she shouldn’t
have said anything so personal, but Aunt Eunice
didn’t at all mind. Instead she smiled one of her
shining smiles, and there even came a little fleck
of pink into her soft old cheeks. She bent to kiss
Caroline, and suddenly, because she just couldn’t
help it, Caroline put her arms round Aunt Eunice
and hugged her, and Aunt Eunice hugged her back.
You don’t know how good that seemed to Caroline.
There had been no one to hug her since her mother
died. Cousin Delia was a very busy woman, and
then, too, alongside the four babies, Caroline doubtless
seemed to her quite grown up, and too old to
need cuddling.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hand in hand Aunt Eunice and Caroline went
down the long curved stair and through the stately
hall into the dining room. Cousin Penelope was already
there and the glass coffee machine, which
Caroline found as fascinating as any mechanical toy,
was distilling an amber-hued, fragrant liquid. They
sat down at once to another of those well-ordered
meals that filled Caroline with amazement—almost
with awe. She hadn’t known that food could be so
good.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were great red strawberries, which still
wore their green elf caps, and little glass dishes of
powdered sugar, into which you dipped the berries
daintily, after a swift glance to see how Cousin
Penelope did it. Then there were bowls of crisp
cereal, with rich cream, and bacon, so thin and so
deftly cooked that it crumbled into savory slivers
under your fork. There were thin slices of brown
toast, piping hot, and there were wee muffins of
bran, which came to the table in a silver dish,
wrapped cozily in a fine white napkin. There were
little balls of fresh butter, and in a bewitching jar,
shaped like a beehive, there was strained honey.
All the milk to drink, too, that one could want.
And would Jacqueline like an egg for her breakfast?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, no, please,” murmured Jacqueline’s
understudy, and then, remembering the cold egg that
she had lately eaten from the shoe box, she added:
“I—I’m not extra fond of eggs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neither am I,” Cousin Penelope said heartily.</p>

<p class='c009'>Funny, thought Caroline, that Cousin Penelope
should be so pleased at every resemblance between
them, but very nice of her. In time she thought
she should like Cousin Penelope, though never so
much as she <i>loved</i> Aunt Eunice.</p>

<p class='c009'>After breakfast Aunt Eunice asked Caroline to
come walk with her in the garden, and said, yes,
she could bring Mildred. So Mildred, in her pink-sprayed
frock and white bonnet, and Aunt Eunice
and Caroline walked soberly in the shadiest parts of
the garden. Aunt Eunice wore a broad hat, tied
under her chin with wide streamers of lawn. She
paused once to give directions to Frank, who was
gardener as well as chauffeur, and much more human
in khaki overalls than Caroline had thought
him the day before in his imposing uniform.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice showed Caroline all the special beauties
of the garden—her new rosebushes and her old
thrifty plot of perennials, the pear trees that later
would furnish them fruit more delicious, Aunt Eunice
believed, than any they could buy in the shops,
and the row of gooseberry bushes, where the berries
already were setting in tiny, reddish furry blobs.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the farther side of the garden they sat down
in a little rustic summer house, covered with woodbine.
Caroline gazed with all her eyes at the scene
before her—the garden with its bright flowers of
early summer, blues and pinks and strong yellows,
and its fruit trees, with gray-lined leaves of glossy
green, its smooth white walks and dark edges of
box, and beyond the garden the old white house, with
its clustered chimnies, the elms that shaded it, the
mountain far beyond, the blue sky over all. She
thought it as breathlessly, chokingly lovely in its
color and clear outline as the loveliest of the pictures
in her room.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Aunt Eunice looked nearer home. She took
up Mildred, and carefully examined her clothes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What delicate fine stitches!” she said. “Did
you make this dress yourself, Jacqueline?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Aunt Eunice. I can’t sew as well as that.”
Indeed, thought Caroline with pride, not many
people could sew as nicely as her mother, who had
made that precious wardrobe of Mildred’s, every
stitch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you like to sew?” went on Aunt Eunice, with
a little, mysterious smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes,” said Caroline, truthfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>There had been long hours in her life, when
school was over and Mother away giving music lessons,
when she must either run the streets or amuse
herself in their room. Mother had beguiled her with
handiwork to choose the room, and not the street.
Caroline sewed really rather better than most little
girls of her age, and she liked to sew. She wished
that Aunt Eunice could see the pair of rompers she
had made, all alone, for Cousin Delia’s youngest
baby.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll tell you what,” said Aunt Eunice. “I’ll get
out some pretty silk pieces, and you and I will make
this dolly some new dresses. It’s years and years
since I’ve had a doll to sew for. Would you like
that, Jacqueline?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline smiled and patted Aunt Eunice’s plump
white hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d just love it, Aunt Eunice. Can we begin
to-day? I don’t want to lose any time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Indeed she didn’t, the poor little impostor! She
wanted to squeeze all that she could into every
moment that she passed in this dream-house. For
the moments, as she knew, might already be numbered.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there was no doll’s dressmaking that morning,
for just then Sallie came briskly through the
garden with a message. Miss Jacqueline’s trunk
had been sent up, and Miss Penelope wished her
to come at once and see about unpacking.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up in the golden green room, all fresh and ordered
for the day, Caroline looked helplessly at the
big trunk that was Jacqueline’s. When she had got
the key from Jacqueline’s vanity bag, and Sallie had
opened the trunk, and she saw that it opened like
a closet, and glimpsed the frocks all hung on
frames, she looked more helpless still. She was
thankful when Cousin Penelope took charge of
things.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sit down, Jacqueline,” Cousin Penelope bade
with decision. “Sallie will unpack, and I’ll look
things over. It’s the quickest way for me to find
out what you have and what you haven’t, and if you
are like most children, I shall need to know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Caroline sat down in the rocker, with Mildred
on her knee, and in an aloof, cool manner watched
the taking out of what seemed to her the princess-like
wardrobe that had been wished upon her. There
were frocks of organdie and crêpe de chine, of muslin
and fine gingham. There were jumpers of tricotine
and of jersey, and delicate little frilled
blouses of silk. (Privately Caroline wondered
where the <i>everyday</i> frocks could be!) There were
a dozen pairs of shoes and slippers and boots and
sandals, all on nice little beribboned trees. There
were little coats and sweaters of many colors and
all sorts of texture. There were stacks of filmy
undergarments, and lapsful of silken socks. There
were garters and hair-ribbons and handkerchiefs
and silk gloves. There was a lovely little blue
leather writing-case, and a jewel-case, and a camera.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything in the trunk Caroline, sitting gravely
silent, admired with all her heart, except the riding
suit. When she saw the little white breeches and
the sleeveless brown coat unfolded, her heart sank
within her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Cousin Penelope!” she cried in despair.
“Have I <i>got</i> to ride horseback?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was almost in tears. She had never been on a
horse in her life. If they put her on one, they’d
know in a minute she wasn’t Jacqueline, and the
piano and the Polish lady would be lost to her
forever.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope came to her side. For the first
time Caroline saw her protective and almost tender.
She understood it all, did Penelope. That horsy
Amazon, Edith Delane, had forced that sensitive,
timid little girl, who was <i>all</i> Gildersleeve, as any one
could see, into riding horseback and doing the
athletic feats to which the Delane woman had referred
in her letters. Well, the Delane woman was
hundreds of miles away, and Penelope was here in
charge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We arranged for a saddle-horse, as your aunt
wished,” she told Caroline. “But you are <i>not</i> going
to ride <i>at all</i>, my dear, unless you wish to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So the horrid specter of a ramping steed was
laid at rest, and Caroline went happily through the
hours of the day that was brimful of wonders.
She played for an hour on the piano. She ate a
luncheon that seemed to her grander than most
dinners. Then she sat with Aunt Eunice in Aunt
Eunice’s room, which was furnished with old dark
pieces of polished wood, with glass knobs on the
drawers. Aunt Eunice had the dearest of work
tables, all unexpected drawers and cubbies, and she
had a piecebox full of pretties that she could turn
into trifles for bazaars—bits of silk and satin, velvet
and brocade, quarter-yards of wide figured ribbon,
bits of lace and silver tissue, flowers of silk.</p>

<p class='c009'>Together Aunt Eunice and Caroline planned a
sumptuous party frock for Mildred, and they even
cut it out and gave her a first fitting, which Mildred
endured with more patience than some young ladies
display on such occasions.</p>

<p class='c009'>They did not get beyond the fitting, though, for
Cousin Penelope came strolling in, to say that Jacqueline
had better dress now. They must be going
along to Madame Woleski’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just stop at Miss Crevey’s, will you, and get me
some thread,” bade Aunt Eunice. “I shall need
eighty cotton and a spool of sixty, if Jacqueline
and I are going into the dressmaking business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed to Caroline hardly necessary to change
her frock. She thought the henna-colored crêpe
good enough for almost any occasion. But of
course she did not argue with Cousin Penelope. She
was terribly afraid lest she might make herself too
fine, but she took Cousin Penelope as a guide, just
as she did at the table, and she decided that if
Cousin Penelope wore a cool muslin, she would
wear muslin, too. So she put on a pretty muslin,
with small yellow roses on a white ground and yellow
flowers of organdie at the ribbon girdle. Her
socks were of white silk and her sandals of white
kid. From the hatbox she selected a white leghorn,
with stalks of yellow wheat and some wee blue
flowers round the crown.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was in two minds about opening the jewel-case.
She had the key in Jacqueline’s vanity bag,
tied fast to the trunk key, but it seemed rather horrid
to make free with Jacqueline’s jewelry. Still if
she didn’t wear any, people might suspect she wasn’t
Jacqueline. So she unlocked the leather case, and
marveled at all the pretty pins and chains that she
found laid in the little velvet lined drawers. She
selected a chain of queer small beads, with flecks
of yellow and blue and green in them that would go
nicely with the colors in her dress and her hat.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed that she had by chance selected very
wisely, for when Cousin Penelope came to look her
over, she fairly flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you put on the beads I sent you,” she cried.
“That’s a very pretty tribute, Jacqueline.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I like them,” stammered Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So do I!” said Cousin Penelope, quite merrily.
“How many things we have in common!”</p>

<p class='c009'>This made Caroline feel at home with Cousin
Penelope, and they chattered together, quite volubly
for two people so shy and self-contained, while they
drove through Longmeadow Street to Madame
Woleski’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>The house that the Polish lady had taken for the
summer was quite at the farther end of the Street,
right under the shadow of the mountain. It was
a little, irregular house which had been an artist’s.
The living room had a big window on the north side,
and the piano was drawn across it. The furniture
was old and dingy, and nothing matched with anything
else, thought Caroline. There were dark,
rich-looking small rugs on the floor, and on the
walls were unframed sketches, which seemed to
Caroline to look like not much of anything, unless
it were the drawings that Cousin Delia’s eldest baby
made. But Caroline didn’t know as much about
pictures as she knew about music.</p>

<p class='c009'>Madame Woleski was thin and dark, with an intense
face and untidy hair, and long, nervous hands.
She smiled at Caroline vaguely and sent her to play
in the garden, while she talked with Cousin
Penelope.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline didn’t like the garden. She was afraid
of hurting Jacqueline’s pretty clothes. But she
found a clean bench where she could sit in safety,
and then along came a great fluffy cat, the color
of an orange, and he was friendly, after a condescending
fashion, so she was able to get through the
time until she was called into the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Madame Woleski wanted Caroline to play for
her, and Caroline did so, quite simply. Mother had
taught her long ago that when you were asked to
play, you either declined with all courtesy, or you
sat down and played. There was no excuse for
shilly-shallying and waiting to be urged.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline played, and Madame listened, and when
the playing was over, a maid brought in a silver
tea-service, and they had some crumbly dark fruit
cookies, and fragrant strong tea, and tiny slim
glasses of cordial. Caroline of course only had
cookies. She said, no thanks! to the tea and the
cordial, and Madame smiled at her, and offered her
some crystallized fruit in a silver box.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Next time you come, I have milk for you to
drink, little one,” she said. “Because you come
again. But before you come, you do every day two
hours thees exercise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She went herself to the piano and showed what
“thees exercise” should be, and she told Caroline
she might come and play for her in the morning,
three days later.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the call was ended, and Caroline and Cousin
Penelope were rolling away in the limousine from
the funny little house, while Madame Woleski, with
the orange cat carelessly tucked under her arm, like
a piece of fur, nodded them a good-by from her
sunken doorstone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear!” said Cousin Penelope, with real enthusiasm.
“Do you realize that you are now a pupil
of Woleski’s?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline nodded solemnly. She was too happy
to chatter as she had done on the way to the little
house. But she was no happier than Cousin Penelope.
For Penelope had loved her cousin, Jack
Gildersleeve, and now she had his child, who in
spite of everything was like her, here beside her
in the car, and she was going to give her what her
coarse and stupid Delane relatives, with all their
wealth, had failed to give her—the music that she
loved and craved!</p>

<p class='c009'>So completely was Penelope carried away with
her vision of Jacqueline some day a great musician,
and turning to her—not to the Delanes!—for understanding
and sympathy, that they had driven past
the shops before she realized it. Then she smiled
at her own preoccupation, and told Frank to turn
back.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were only four shops on Longmeadow
Street. They stood in the very center of the village,
in the shadow of the Orthodox church, and just
across the street from the little inn. There was a
general store, and the Post Office, where you
bought hardware and sundries, and a meat market,
which was open only twice a week, and Miss Crevey’s
little shop, where you could buy talcum and
tape, peppermints and pins, and altogether the funniest
mixture of drygoods and druggist’s supplies,
confectionery and notions that ever was seen outside
the shop that the old sheep kept in the Looking
Glass Country.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eighty cotton and sixty cotton,” said Cousin
Penelope, as she and Caroline, in their cool pretty
frocks, stepped out of the limousine. “I’ll get a
cube of black pins, too, and some laces for my walking
shoes. One ought to encourage the little local
shops—they’re a great convenience.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline smiled, but not at Cousin Penelope’s
words. She was smiling at the world. Because
she had on a party frock, and was going home to
dinner with dear Aunt Eunice, and she was a pupil
of Woleski’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>Smilingly, Caroline tripped up the steps at
Cousin Penelope’s side, and into the little crowded
shop, and then the smile left her face just the way
figures leave a slate when you draw a wet sponge
across it. For she saw two children standing at
the counter, where the cheap candies were displayed.
One was a boy in old knickers and a shabby shirt,
the other was a girl in faded Peggy Janes, and Caroline
had recognized those Peggy Janes and knew
what was coming, even before the girl turned her
bobbed brown head and showed the face of Jacqueline
Gildersleeve.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c010'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />TWO PENNIES TO SPEND</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Jacqueline waked early on her first morning
at the Conway farm. With a rooster crowing
under your window, you need no alarm clock,
and with a cozy six-year-old at your side, inclined to
snuggle on a warm morning, you have no inducements
to lie abed.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Jacqueline jumped up and dressed herself. She
put on the Peggy Janes that she had marked with
approval the night before, and she slipped her bare
feet into Caroline’s old sneakers. She washed her
face and hands at the marble-topped washstand.
The washbasin had a green landscape in the bottom,
very pleasant to look at through the clear
water, but the pitcher belonged to a different set
and was ornamented with purple bands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nellie chattered in a lively manner all through
the hasty dressing process, mostly about some new
kittens and a rooster named General Pershing.
She dressed herself very handily, but she didn’t scorn
Jacqueline’s help when it came to the back buttons
of her underwaist and overalls.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early as the children were, they found, when
they climbed down the funny steep stairs into the
kitchen, that Grandma and Aunt Martha and the
babies were up before them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a nice rig for the country, Jackie,” Aunt
Martha said approvingly, as she spied the Peggy
Janes. “I’m glad you didn’t bring any starched up
city notions to the farm. There’s time and place
for everything, of course,” she added tolerantly,
“but high heeled shoes and frilly dresses don’t go
with the soil.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Freddie had remembered Jacqueline over night,
perhaps because of the piece of shapeless chocolate
that she had popped into his mouth. He threw
himself upon her with gurgles of greeting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He takes to you all right,” said Grandma, as
she paused with a pan of biscuits in her hand, midway
from stove to table. “I wonder now if a smart
girl like you couldn’t take it on herself to dress him
mornings. Every minute counts this time o’ day,
and your Aunt Martha has her hands full.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure I will,” Jacqueline promised airily. She
was promising only for a few days—just as few
as she chose to make them. And she really did
like Freddie. He was more fun than a puppy
dog.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just pump that pitcher full of water, Jackie,
and fill the glasses at the table,” Aunt Martha
struck in briskly. “Ring the bell, Nellie. Breakfast’s
about ready.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nellie sprang on a chair, and took down a big
dinner bell from the shelf above the stove. But
she didn’t ring it at the foot of the stairs to rouse
her sleepy brothers—oh, no! She went out on
the doorstone in the soft clear morning air, and she
clanged that bell as if all Longmeadow Street were
burning up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Very quickly the three boys came scuffling in from
the barn and sheds where they had been doing the
first chores of the day. They washed hurriedly at
the sink—so hurriedly that Aunt Martha sent Neil
back to do it all over again. Then they sat down
to breakfast in the shabby, homely dining room, that
wasn’t a bit like the rural interiors that Jacqueline
had seen on the stage and in the movies.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were no frills about that breakfast any
more than there had been about the supper. On
the table was a big plate of hot raised biscuits, fluffy
and light, and a platter of freshly cooked hash,
meat and potatoes (more potatoes than meat!)
warmed on the stove in what Aunt Martha called a
“spider,” crisp and brown on the outside, soft and
savory within. There was milk for the children,
and coffee in a shiny tin pot for Aunt Martha and
Grandma. Freddie and Annie had porridge. Aunt
Martha fed Annie spoonsful with one hand, and
ate her own breakfast with the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both at Buena Vista and at school, fried things
and hot breads had been considered unhygienic. Being
forbidden, they had always seemed to Jacqueline
desirable. She ate two helpings of hash and three
biscuits and a half. She wanted to eat four, the
same as Dickie did, but she had to give up, beaten.
She could chew still, but she couldn’t swallow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now you and Nellie see how nice you can clear
the table and wash the dishes, and then put the dining
room to rights,” said Aunt Martha, as if she
asked the most natural thing in the world. “Grandma’ll
be here to oversee. I’ve got to go down to
the ten acre, and see if that Polack is on the job,
or just getting over the christening party they had
last night at the Corners.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha tied on a straw hat, nodded to her
family, and went her competent way. The boys
went, too, quite like men of business. In these days
of high wages, when Polish farm-hands expected
fifty cents an hour, you either let your youngsters
work in the fields, or closed up shop and went “on
the town,” Grandma told Jacqueline, as one who
endured what could not be cured. Ralph was as
good as a man on the place, she added proudly.
He’d be weeding onions now until the sun got too
hot. Dickie and Neil would be working in the
vegetable garden, which supplied the family table
and a few good paying customers on Longmeadow
Street.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’ll be hungry as horses by noon,” said
Grandma. “I guess I’ll flax round and stir ’em
up some gingerbread.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Grandma seemed chief cook of the establishment.
Already she had baked a batch of bread since she
got up, and had dried-apple pies to pop into the
oven, and a piece of meat—to Jacqueline it looked
mostly bone and gristle—simmering on the back of
the stove, lest it spoil in the hot weather. She now
mixed gingerbread, as spry as you please, and meantime
gave directions about putting Annie outside in
the baby pen, and taking the table-leavings to the
hens, and setting another kettle of hot water to boil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll need some rinsing water or your dishes
will be streaked,” she told Jacqueline. “There’s a
right way and a wrong way to do everything, even
dishes, and it’s just as easy to do it right as wrong.”
Jacqueline didn’t mind, for one day only. She
thought dish washing rather a game. She and Nellie
brought the things out from the dining room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take the tray,” said Grandma, “and bring a
lot at a time. Always made your head save your
heels.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then they rinsed the milky glasses, and they
scraped the plates. Jacqueline was going to add to
the scraps for the hens the bit of hash that was on
the platter, but Grandma stopped her with a gesture
of positive horror.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mercy, child! Don’t throw away good clean
victuals, even if the war <i>is</i> over. Put it in that
clean little cracked dish. It’ll warm up nice and
tasty for somebody’s supper. The butter goes in
that stone jar. Let those biscuits cool before you
put ’em into the bread box. Never shut up hot
bread in a close box, or it’ll spoil on you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>What a lot of things to remember, thought
Jacqueline! This was more exciting than mental arithmetic.</p>

<p class='c009'>She washed the dishes just as Grandma told her,
and Nellie wiped them painstakingly. First they
did the glasses, then “the silver”—poor plated ware
that it was!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be sure to get the tines of the forks clean,”
cautioned Grandma. “And remember, when we
have eggs, not to plump your silver and your dishes
into hot water, or you’ll cook the egg right to ’em.
Wash eggy things first in cold water, always.”
After the silver, came the plates and the cups,
and last of all “the calicoes,” as Grandma called the
cooking dishes. Then the dish pan must be scalded,
and the dish towels set to boil upon the stove, and
while they were boiling, Jacqueline brushed up the
dining room, rather an amateurish job, but Grandma
said she took hold handily. Then Jacqueline and
Nellie, each with a big square of soft cloth, dusted
the dining room furniture, and last of all, they hung
their dish towels out in the warm sun to dry.</p>

<p class='c009'>By that time Jacqueline had had enough of housework.
She was ready to say so, and to quit right
then and there. But Grandma said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re a big help, Jackie. Your aunt’s awful
busy outside, and I’m not as quick on my feet as
I was. Some days it seems like I’d never get
through step-stepping.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Well, when a little old lady says a thing like that
to you, of course you can’t flop down on the dining-room
couch with a story paper and leave her to work
all alone. So while Nellie kept an eye on Freddie
and Annie, Jacqueline went upstairs with Grandma
and did the chamber work and had her first lesson
in bed-making. As there were four beds, besides
Freddie’s crib, she had had quite a lot of practice
by the time they finished.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Make a handsome bed, you’ll get a handsome
husband, they used to tell me when I was a girl,”
chuckled Grandma. “You want to do your best,
Jackie, unless you aim to be one o’ these new women
that get along without men folks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After the beds were made, Jacqueline and Nellie
each had a piece of gingerbread, and they took two
big pieces for Dickie and Neil, and went out to
them in the garden. It was quite a big garden, with
poles of beans and rows of peas, trained up on dry
bushes, tomato plants and cucumber vines, beets and
lettuce, squash and pumpkins. But there were no
onions. You got onions by the peck out of the great
fields that spread all round the farm. For the Conways,
like their neighbors, put all their land into
onions, and on the price of onions their fortunes
hung.</p>

<p class='c009'>They dined at noon at the Conway farm, and
dinner was all of cold things, so as not to heat the
kitchen in the middle of the day. There was ready
cooked cereal, and a pitcher of milk. There were
great slices of home-made bread, with home-made
plum jam. (Jacqueline had gone down with
Grandma into the deep cold cellar where the food was
kept, and she had seen the shelves where the jars of
home-canned fruits and vegetables lived. Next
time she could go down herself and save Grandma’s
old legs.) There was cottage cheese, and lettuce,
and sliced tomatoes. There was gingerbread—all
the gingerbread that any one could wish to eat.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the dinner dishes were cleared away and
left to be washed at night when it was cooler, Aunt
Martha and Grandma sat down to sew and mend
for their big family.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll have to count on you to do your own mending,”
Aunt Martha told Jacqueline. “But you just
run out to the barn now, and play.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline went. She wanted to see those kittens.
She also wanted to try some hazardous
stunts that she had thought up, as soon as she had
seen the beams and ladders in the barn. Neil and
Nellie came with her, and Dickie presently joined
them. Of course Dickie could do acrobatic feats
that none of them could equal. But Jacqueline felt
she did pretty well at balancing on her hands for
the first time, and she could put her ankle behind
her neck as well as any of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>She thought they had been playing only the least
little while, but really it was in the middle of the
afternoon when the big bell rang. They scampered
at once to the house. That was the law of the farm:
always run when you hear the bell, or you may miss
something you wouldn’t like to miss.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha was on the doorstone, talking to
a bearded man in a muddy Ford.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurry up!” she called, as soon as the children
came within earshot. “Here’s Mr. Griswold driving
up to town and he has room for two. Get your
purse, Jackie. Here’s a chance to buy you that
toothbrush. Neil, you can go with her and show
her the way home. You’ll have to hoof it back,
unless you find somebody coming down to the Meadows
that will give you a lift.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Adventure beckoned! Jacqueline thought nothing
of the walk through the dust in the heat. She
flew upstairs and got Caroline’s shabby purse, and
flew down again. Perhaps where they were going,
she could get a soda, one for herself and one, of
course, for Neil.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha must have read her thoughts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now don’t you go wasting that money,” she
ordered. “You ought to get you a brush for fifteen
cents at Miss Crevey’s. You bring back thirty-five
cents.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Aunt Martha!” protested Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you forget what I say.” Aunt Martha
fixed Jacqueline with gray eyes that looked her
through and through. “Jump in now. Mr. Griswold’s
waiting.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline didn’t stop to argue. She jumped in,
and Neil jumped in beside her, and away they rattled
with the friendly neighboring farmer, through the
hot-smelling fields of green onions. As they rattled
along, a heartening thought came to Jacqueline.
She had fifty cents in her purse, and two pennies.
Aunt Martha had said nothing about the pennies.
She could spend them. She didn’t quite know what
you could get for two cents, that was good, but there
must be something.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Griswold put down his little passengers at
the Orthodox church in Longmeadow Street. He
was going on to Northford himself to get a young
pig in a crate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now show me the shop,” Jacqueline bade Neil.
She had taken command of him, much as she had
taken command of Caroline. “And I’ve got two
pennies to spend as I please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gee!” said Neil. “That’s great.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He meant it, too. Jacqueline looked at him in
wonder. She counted her spending money usually,
when she troubled herself to count it at all, in dimes
and quarters, never in copper pennies.</p>

<p class='c009'>They went into Miss Crevey’s shop. A funny
little shop Jacqueline thought it, and she thought
Miss Crevey with her false front, and her ill-fitted
false teeth, and her alpaca sleeves, was like a character
in a story book. They got the toothbrush
readily enough—that part of the shopping was
simple and uninteresting. But to spend the precious
two pennies was different. There was such a choice
of things for a penny—a tiny glass measure of hard
red and white candies—or a stick of gum—or two
large white peppermints—or a stick of striped
candy. Jacqueline wanted the gum very much, for
at home she had never been allowed to chew it.
But Neil, she could see, hungered for a dreadful
confection of molasses, imperfectly covered with
chocolate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll get both,” suggested Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—you see——” Neil hesitated. “If we get
all those little jiggers for a penny, we’ll have something
to take home to the kids.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline looked at him and slowly reddened.
She hadn’t thought of the kids. Indeed she had
thought two pennies hardly big enough to divide
between two children, let alone five. But Neil had
thought of the younger ones.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll have that chocolate stick, please,” Jacqueline
told Miss Crevey with sudden generous resolve,
“and a glass dingus of the little jigs. After all, I
don’t care for gum.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And just as she said the words, she heard the
door creak open behind her and she turned her
head. There on the threshold stood a prim lady
in a white summer frock, and with her a little girl
in a posy-strewn muslin (Jacqueline’s muslin!) who
looked as scared as if she had seen a ghost, and
the little girl, of course, was Caroline!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c010'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />A FAIR ENCOUNTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>For poor little Caroline the moment was tragic.</p>

<p class='c009'>Quite sincerely she expected Jacqueline to step
up to her and say in a loud voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>I</i> am Jacqueline, and you are Caroline. Take
off that dress of mine, and go away with this horrid
little staring red-haired boy. <i>I</i> shall go home with
Cousin Penelope in the limousine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>What else could Caroline expect? Why <i>should</i>
any living child continue to wear clumsy, hateful
Peggy Janes, with patches, too, when she could have
a beautiful muslin, with yellow roses? No, Jacqueline
surely would never go on with the deception,
now that she saw with her own eyes the glories of
which she had deprived herself!</p>

<p class='c009'>But to Jacqueline the encounter that to Caroline
was tragic seemed downright funny. To think of
her, standing there in Caroline’s Peggy Janes, and
Caroline in her muslin, and that prim-looking Cousin
Penelope (whom Jacqueline disliked at sight!) innocently
lavishing attention on the wrong child. So
good a joke it was that Jacqueline wanted it to last
a little longer, and she was afraid that Caroline,
with her shocked face, was going to give it all away.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the moment Cousin Penelope spoke to Miss
Crevey—and she spoke to her almost instantly, for
the two children had taken stock of each other in
far less time than it has taken to tell—Jacqueline
edged up alongside Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello!” she spoke softly, like a child who
wanted to scrape acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline stared at her dumbly. Her lips
quivered. If she should begin to bawl, she certainly
<i>would</i> spill the beans, thought Jacqueline, and
acted with a wisdom that was almost inspired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My name is Caroline Tait,” said Jacqueline,
slowly and emphatically. Like the Ancient Mariner,
she held Caroline with a glittering eye.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline drew a fluttering breath—the first she
had drawn since her eyes fell on the Peggy Janes.
If Jacqueline said that, why, perhaps Jacqueline
meant still to keep on being Caroline!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I live at my aunt’s farm, down to the Meadows,”
went on Jacqueline calmly. “What’s your name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“C-C——” clucked Caroline helplessly, and
quailed before Jacqueline’s furious eye. “C—Jacqueline,”
she achieved the name with something
like a sneeze.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope suddenly became aware of the
by-play going on at her elbow. She turned and
looked coldly at the dusty little girl in the uncouth,
shabby clothes, who had been so rude as to address
her darling. Caroline trembled, just as she had
trembled when she first saw Cousin Penelope. But
Jacqueline looked up at Cousin Penelope coolly and
without terror, and even with her chin slightly tilted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello!” she addressed the august lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope’s violet eyes looked through
Jacqueline, quite as if she hadn’t been there. Then
she turned with a smile to Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, Jacqueline,” she addressed Jacqueline’s
substitute. “You must help me buy this thread.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Deliberately she turned her back on Jacqueline,
and made Caroline turn with her, as if she snatched
her little charge from contamination.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline laughed outright. It was rude and
horrid of her, although Cousin Penelope had herself
been rude. But Jacqueline really hadn’t meant
to laugh. Only Cousin Penelope struck her as funny,
and the whole situation, too, was funny.</p>

<p class='c009'>A slight flush rose to Cousin Penelope’s cheeks.
Of course it was foolish to let one’s self be annoyed
by the bad manners of a country child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is that bold little girl?” she asked Miss
Crevey.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her voice was louder than she meant it to be, or
Jacqueline’s ears were sharper. Jacqueline overheard,
and hugged herself for joy, the naughty thing!</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s one of the Conway children from down in
the Meadows,” lisped Miss Crevey, as she tied up
the little parcel of thread and pins. “Call again,
Miss Gildersleeve. Sorry I didn’t have no shoelaces,
but people buy ’em off me so fast I jes’ give
up keepin’ ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope nodded graciously, and with the
parcel in one hand and Caroline’s limp fingers
clasped in the other, walked out of the shop. When
they were once more shut in the limousine, away
from the vulgar herd, she turned to Caroline and
saw that she was quite pale and trembling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t like strangers, do you, any more than
I,” Cousin Penelope said sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline nodded. She really didn’t know what
else to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was a very rude, coarse, pushing little
girl,” Cousin Penelope spoke with more heat than
she realized. “I don’t want you to have anything
to do with such people. She belongs to a quite
ordinary family down in the Meadows—and blood,
you know, will always tell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She smiled as she said the words. How blood
<i>had</i> told in this charming little quiet girl beside her,
who was all Gildersleeve! Cousin Penelope smiled
and was glad when she saw Caroline smile at last
in answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know there are some nice little girls, here
in town,” said Cousin Penelope. “As soon as you
feel at home with us, I’ll give a little party for you
and ask them to meet you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh-h!” cried Caroline softly, a real little trill
of rapture. She had never had a party in her life,
nor expected to have one. How good Cousin
Penelope was to her, and Jacqueline, too, who was
going to keep on with this precious play! The
world was beautiful once more, as beautiful as it
had been when she went into Miss Crevey’s shop.
All the way home she chattered again, almost
volubly, with kind Cousin Penelope.</p>

<p class='c009'>While Caroline was rolling homeward to The
Chimnies in the limousine, Jacqueline was trudging
along the same road on foot. She and Neil had
made their purchases. The little red and white
candies, in the bag that Jacqueline had insisted upon
having, in spite of Miss Crevey’s grumbling, were
in the breast pocket of the Peggy Janes. The stick
of candy was in the stomachs of Jacqueline and
Neil, all except that portion of the moist chocolate
that was round their mouths. Neil went in manful
silence, lost in pleasant memories of the departed
sweet. But Jacqueline now and again chuckled to
herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What you snickering at?” Neil challenged at
last.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aw, nothing,” said Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only fools laugh at nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Jacqueline unabashed, “<i>I</i> was
laughing at a fool. Where does she live?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That stuck up old thing, Miss Gildersleeve, that
we saw in the shop. Gee! I’d hate to have her
bossing me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s an old hen,” said Neil. “You’d ought to
’a’ heard her bawl me out, time I run acrost
her old lawn with the cream Mother forgot to leave.
Mother won’t like it though if you sass her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will if I like,” Jacqueline answered calmly.
“Where does she hang out?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re most there now,” said Neil. “It’s that
big white house with the hedge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shucks!” said Jacqueline. (She had added to
her vocabulary already at the farm.) “That isn’t
half as big as Buena Vista.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s Boona Vister?”</p>

<p class='c009'>To herself Jacqueline said: “You most put your
foot in it that time!” Aloud she told Neil airily:
“Oh, it’s a place where I was once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it like the amusement park at the Pines with
the puzzle-house?” Neil asked hopefully. “I was
there once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something like, I guess,” Jacqueline answered
vaguely.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was busy staring at the Gildersleeve place, as
they skirted the tall hedge. The sort of place where
you mustn’t step on the lawn or pick the flowers.
The sort of house where there wouldn’t be enough
sunshine, and you must walk softly. She thought
of Cousin Penelope, who had snubbed her, and she
made the sort of face she was going to practice now
for Cousin Penelope’s benefit. Then she thought of
Caroline, the dear little silly, and she chuckled again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aw, say,” said Neil, “you got bats in your
belfry?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll say I have—not,” Jacqueline threw off, with
cheerful unconcern.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wasn’t it funny that Caroline should have put on
the muslin with the yellow roses? Jacqueline hated
that dress above all dresses. She had only brought
it in her trunk because Aunt Edith, who had selected
the dress, had made her. She hated the floppy hat,
too, and those nasty old green and blue and yellow
beads of Cousin Penelope’s that it always made her
feel seasick just to look at. If she had claimed her
rightful place that Caroline was filling, she might
have had to wear those odious clothes. Hateful
clothes and bossy old Cousin Penelope, against dish
washing and bed making. On the whole she preferred
the latter—for a time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hey! Hey!” Neil suddenly broke in upon her
reverie with a mighty yell.</p>

<p class='c009'>A bronzed raggedy man in a little truck, which
was creeping past them on a flat tire in a scuff of
dust, heard the call and checked his clumsy vehicle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on!” Neil cried to Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>She didn’t pause to ask any questions. She flew
at his heels across the wide green sward that skirted
the sidewalk, and into the dust of the road. She
swarmed after him in the accommodating Peggy
Janes, up into the body of the truck. Here was a
heap of dusty sacks on which she dropped herself
at his side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gee! This is luck,” Neil panted. “It’s John
Zabriski that used to work for Father. He’s got
the farm the other side of ours. He’ll take us all
the way home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline stretched herself upon the dirty sacks.
The dust was rising round them in a golden cloud
as the truck rolled down Longmeadow Street. The
branches of the elms met overhead, and through
them, as she lay on her back, she gazed into the unfathomable
cobalt of the sky. There would be
creamed codfish for supper, and Johnny-cake, and
dried-apple pie. She had heard Grandma and Aunt
Martha planning the meal. She could scuffle in the
hammock with Neil and Dickie, in the warm, star-set
evening, and tomorrow she meant to walk the
highest beam in the barn. No one to forbid her—no
one to remind her to be a lady—no starched and
stuck up Cousin Penelope to give her orders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gee!” murmured Jacqueline. “This sure is
the life!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />OVER THE TEACUPS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Caroline and Aunt Eunice sat in the summer
house, making doll clothes. The weather,
like the Little Bear’s porridge, was neither too hot
nor too cold, but just right. A little breeze made
the flowers in the garden curtsy like so many tall
belles, arrayed in bright hues for a merrymaking
at the court of the fairies. That was what Caroline
told Aunt Eunice. She found it easy to tell Aunt
Eunice all sorts of things.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice sat in a cushioned wicker armchair,
which Frank had brought out for her, and Caroline
sat in a low rocker. Mildred sat on the bench at
their elbow, lightly clad in a lace-edged camisole
and snowy French drawers. She bore herself with
the fine dignity and indifference that a queen of the
ancient régime surrounded by her ladies in waiting
would have shown in the like circumstances.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice was frilling lace into a tiny sleeve.
Caroline was setting her finest stitches in the hem
of a silken skirt of peacock blue.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When her new clothes are made, Aunt Eunice,”
said Caroline, in her sweet, serious little voice, “I
think we should let her go on a long journey to
wonderful places.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think so, too,” Aunt Eunice assented.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where should you like to go, Mildred?” asked
Caroline. “To the Snow Queen’s palace in the cold,
blue, frozen north? We are going to make you a
cunning cape of black velvet with a white fur collar,
and I’m sure it would be greatly admired by the
snow elves. Only there are great silvery bears at
the North Pole and they might fancy you for a
tit-bit, my poor darling. I suppose, Aunt Eunice,
they must get tired of eating just seals and Esquimaux
and so on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sure <i>I</i> shouldn’t relish an Esquimau,” said
Aunt Eunice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you shall go south, Mildred,” said Caroline.
“After all, most of your clothes are of silk
and muslin, and better for a warm climate. You
can go to the Isles of Greece where burning Sappho
loved and sang.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice looked up from the tiny sleeve, and
lifted her brows, never so slightly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where did you ever hear of Sappho, child?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was in my reader at school,” Caroline explained,
“and long before that, when I was little, I
had a gray kitten and her name was Sappho. Were
you ever in the Isles of Greece, Aunt Eunice?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” said Caroline, disappointed. “You’ve
been most everywhere else. Well, let’s send Mildred
to Italy, where the citrons are, and bandits, and
beggars, and Pompeii. Oh, Aunt Eunice, won’t
you tell Mildred and me how you went to Pompeii
on your wedding journey?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The little smile brightened on Aunt Eunice’s soft
old face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Jacqueline, dear, you must be sick of the
story of my wedding journey. In the fortnight
you’ve been here, you’ve heard it thirteen times at
least.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fourteen times would be one for every day in
the week,” Caroline suggested, with a twinkle in
her brown eyes that were usually so grave. “Oh,
do tell me again, Aunt Eunice! I love to hear about
strange, beautiful places. When I shut my eyes at
night I see them just as you tell them, and I go to
sleep and dream I am there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice looked at the glowing little face of
her companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’d like to go to Italy, Jacqueline?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to ride in a gondola on a blue lagoon,”
she said, “and see the Alpine glow, and a castle on
the Rhine, and walk in those streets of old ancient
houses in Paris where Notre Dame is that you tell
about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice paid close attention to her stitches.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course,” she said, after a pause, “you’ll go
abroad some day soon with your Aunt Edith.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline gave a quick little sigh. Oh, if only she
need not be made to remember, every now and then,
that she was not—could not be—Jacqueline!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose perhaps I shall,” she said, since she
must say something.</p>

<p class='c009'>To herself Aunt Eunice said indignantly that it
was clear enough that Edith Delane had starved the
soul of this sensitive, beauty-loving child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If only I could show her Venice!” thought Aunt
Eunice, and then, in her turn, she gave a quick little
sigh. She had waited ten years to have Jack’s little
daughter with her for a summer. She might have
to wait another ten years, before the boon was
granted her a second time. In ten years more Aunt
Eunice would be eighty-one. Too old for long
journeys. No use for her to plan!</p>

<p class='c009'>So Aunt Eunice and Caroline, each for good reasons
of her own, lapsed into a silence as deep as
Mildred’s, and not so sunny. It was fortunate
perhaps that just at that moment Cousin Penelope
joined them. She carried a shallow, woven basket
in which were three cups and saucers of egg-shell
thinness, and silver spoons, worn smooth with age,
a glass dish of wafer-like slices of lemon, stuck with
whole cloves, and another dish of crystallized dates.
Behind her came Sallie, with the teapot in its queer
wadded Japanese basket, like an old lady church-ward
borne in Colonial days, and a light wicker
stand of three baskets, each with its own brand of
goodies wrapped in a white napkin—crisp buttered
toast, wee sandwiches of orange marmalade and of
cream cheese, and tiny nut-cakes, coated with caramel
frosting.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline sprang up to help Sallie place the folding
table, and spread the embroidered white cloth
that she carried on her arm, and set out the tea.
Aunt Eunice folded her work neatly. Cousin
Penelope drew up a chair. Only Mildred was idle,
but she wore her idleness like a grace, and no one
ever thought of rebuking her.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the oblique light that filtered through the
leaves of woodbine into the summer house, Aunt
Eunice and Cousin Penelope and Caroline took
their tea. It would have been just like every tea
they had taken in the last fortnight, if Caroline had
not ventured on a crystallized date. A moment
later there rippled across her face a little wave of
discomfort, which did not escape Cousin Penelope.
Strange how quick Cousin Penelope was—even
quicker than Aunt Eunice—to note any change in
Caroline!</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter, Jacqueline?” she asked
promptly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing, Cousin Penelope.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You surely don’t make faces for the fun of it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t tease the child, Penelope,” struck in
Aunt Eunice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother, please! I want to know. These involuntary
twitchings in a child mean something,
always. I’ve been reading Stanley Hall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very recently, Penelope?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the last week, Mother. Tell me, Jacqueline.
There! Your face twitched again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It isn’t anything really, Cousin Penelope,”
pleaded Caroline. “I didn’t mean to—I’m sorry.
It was the sugar on the date—and my tooth——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which tooth?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline almost jumped, so peremptory was
Cousin Penelope’s voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The one with the hole in it,” she faltered, “but
it’s been there ever so long.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well!” said Cousin Penelope.</p>

<p class='c009'>Further words failed her. She looked at Aunt
Eunice. Aunt Eunice looked at her. Volumes of
accusation of Edith Delane were in those looks. A
woman, according to the Gildersleeve code, might as
well neglect a child’s immortal soul as neglect its
teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We won’t waste time with any of these local
dentists,” Cousin Penelope broke the silence in
which Caroline sat quaking. “I shall take Jacqueline
down to Boston early in the morning. It promises
to be a fine day. We’ll take the car. I’ll
have Dr. Stoddard look her over. If he won’t take
her himself, he can tell me of some dentist who
makes a specialty of children.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But this was awful, thought Caroline. Dentistry
was fearfully expensive. Cousin Delia had said so,
when Caroline’s tooth had first begun to trouble
her. And now here was Caroline letting Jacqueline’s
relatives give her dentistry that was meant for
Jacqueline. There were tears in the little girl’s
voice as she pleaded hopelessly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I don’t want to go to a dentist—don’t make
me, please! My tooth doesn’t hurt much—I’m used
to it and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That means the nerve is dying,” said Cousin
Penelope, in a solemn voice. “Of all the criminal
neglect!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, hush!” warned Aunt Eunice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline took out her handkerchief (Jacqueline’s
handkerchief!) and wiped her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jacqueline, dear,” said Cousin Penelope awkwardly.
She moved closer to Caroline and actually
put her hand on her shoulder. “I wasn’t angry with
you. I was thinking of something else, if I spoke
sharply.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Must</i> I go to the dentist?” persisted Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we’ll do more than go to the dentist,” urged
Cousin Penelope. “Listen, dear, we’ll go shopping.
We’ll buy all the things for the party I promised
you—invitations, and favors, and prizes. We’ll
select the candies and the ices. Why, we’ll plan the
whole party on this trip, and shop for it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline looked at her, with wet eyes. One word
of the truth, and she would save herself from being
dentistried under false pretenses. But she would
say farewell to the piano, and Madame Woleski,
and the party. Caroline was going on eleven, and
she had never had a party.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I d-don’t mind the dentist,” she assured Cousin
Penelope, with a watery smile. “You’re very good
about the party. I shall love to go to Boston with
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope smiled at Aunt Eunice, who
smiled back. They wouldn’t have admitted, even
to their own consciences, that they smiled a little for
triumph over Edith Delane, as well as for pleasure
at the pleasure they gave the supposed Jacqueline.
And Caroline smiled to herself, as she dried her
eyes, because she thought of her party. Mildred,
you see, with her fixed, calm smile was the only one
of the four who knew the situation upside down and
inside out and roundabout, and who was able therefore
to smile tolerantly and perhaps a little compassionately
at them all.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />OVER THE DARNING BASKET</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>On that fine summer afternoon, neither too hot
nor too cold but just right, when Caroline
sewed her silken seam and dreamed of foreign
lands, Jacqueline sat in the shabby hammock in the
Conways’ scuffed-up side-yard, and darned stockings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know now,” murmured Jacqueline, “why the
worst thing you can say of anything is ‘darn it!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>There were not a great many stockings, for the
little Conways, and Jacqueline, too, went barelegged
as much as possible, but every stocking had at least
one hole, and often the holes came in places that
had been darned before. Then you must be most
particularly careful not to do the dull work hurriedly
and leave rough places that would blister tender
heels and little toes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a right way and a wrong way to do
everything,” said Grandma Conway, as she pulled
out the threads that Jacqueline in her haste had
drawn all puckery. “It’s as easy to do it right as
wrong.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline pouted a little as she took back the
ugly brown stocking, with her work all undone, but
none the less she wove her needle carefully in and
out of the frayed threads, as Grandma expected her
to do. For Jacqueline, you see, liked Grandma, as
she had never liked the teachers or the governesses
that she had always managed to “get round.” You
couldn’t “get round” Grandma, any more than you
could “get round” a bas-relief. And if she made
you do your work just so, she treated the boys in
the same fashion. There was no partiality at the
Conway farm.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Jacqueline darned stockings on that sunny
afternoon, and Grandma, in the worn rocker that
Jacqueline had dragged out for her, patched garments
already so often patched that you had to hunt
to find the original fabric. Great wafts of warm,
odorous air came from the acres of onions. The
bees were murmurous about their squat, white
hives. A woodpecker tapped in the tree above
Jacqueline’s head. Then with a great clatter an
ancient Ford came bounding along the dirt road and
vanished ultimately in a cloud of silvery dust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My land,” chuckled Grandma, and her old
eyes twinkled behind her steel-bowed spectacles.
“Wouldn’t our great-grandfathers have had a conniption
fit, if they’d seen a thing like that go rattlety-banging
through the Meadows? They’d have jailed
somebody for witchcraft, sure enough. ‘Carriages
without horses’, same as old Mother Shipton
prophesied.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Weren’t they cruel and stupid in those old
times?” said Jacqueline, with her mind still full of
the slaughterous doings and inhuman punishments
of “The Prince and the Pauper.” “Think of anybody
being silly enough to think some poor old
woman was a witch!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, perhaps we wouldn’t have done much better,
if we’d been living then,” said Grandma tolerantly.
“You’ve got to judge folks according to
their circumstances. Now take those old, ancient
folks, living here on the edge of what was then a
howling wilderness, and not knowing what might
pop out on ’em any minute—a catamount, maybe, or
like as not a painted Indian, with a scalping knife.
You can’t blame ’em if their nerves got kind of
raw, and they began to see things that weren’t there
and believe things that weren’t so, and then raise
the cry of ‘Witch!’ and go persecuting some poor
neighbor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Were there really ever any Indians here in
Longmeadow?” asked Jacqueline, round-eyed.
That there should have been Indians in the wild
California canyons and in the somber deserts she
could easily believe, but this New England village,
with its orderly meadows and its well-trained elms,
seemed the last place where gruesome tragedy could
ever have been staged.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I guess there was a few, off and on,” said
Grandma placidly. “Didn’t your Pa, and he a
Longmeadow boy, ever tell you ’bout old Aunt
Hetty Tait, that was your ever so many times
great-grandmother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>With conviction Jacqueline shook her head. How
should she ever have heard of Caroline’s ancestresses?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, now!” said Grandma pityingly, and
wiped her spectacles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me, please—please!” cried Jacqueline,
bouncing up and down in the aged hammock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Land sakes, child, it’s lucky that hammock is
strung up good and strong, or you’d come down
ker-flummocks! Just you go on with your darning,
whilst I tell you what there is to tell. ’Taint much.
Hetty Tait wasn’t aunt to anybody then, nor was
she old. She was a young, blooming girl from down
river, born in Allingham, that Nathan Tait fetched
here a bride, when first this settlement was made.
Their farm was up to the north end of town, and
the woods ran right down into their pasture land.
One day Hetty was making soft soap at the big fireplace
in the kitchen, with her two babies asleep in
the cradle right at hand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Grandma! Don’t say anything happened to the
babies!” cried Jacqueline, with a swift thought of
Annie’s golden head.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sphinx-like, Grandma went on:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was a balmy day in spring, and the door stood
wide open. Nathan Tait had gone into town.
Hetty was alone on the place. All at once, though
she hadn’t heard a sound, she sensed she wasn’t
alone. She whirled round quick as scat, and lo and
behold you! there was a great big six-foot savage,
with a scalp tied to his belt and a knife in his hand,
just stepping cat-footed into her kitchen, and his
eyes on her babies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on, Grandma! Go on, or I’ll scream!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s just what Hetty didn’t waste time
a-doing, Jackie. Quicker ’n you can say Jack Robinson,
she scooped up the scalding hot soap in the
great huge ladle she had in her hand, and let drive
fair and square at the Indian’s face. He didn’t
linger after that. He took out at the door, and
Hetty bestowed another ladleful upon his naked
back, to speed his footsteps. Then she double
barred the door and took down her husband’s fowling
piece and kept watch till her husband’s return,
not knowing, of course, whether he would return, or
whether he’d be ambushed on the road from town,
as many a man was in those old days. You can’t
blame those folks, Jackie, if they were sort of hard.
Life wasn’t what you might call soft with them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll play that game to-morrow,” Jacqueline announced
with snapping eyes. “I’ll be Hetty, and
Freddie and Annie can be the babies, and Neil shall
be the Injun—only of course I’ll throw cold water
on him, not hot soap. It won’t hurt him really,
Grandma.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll trust Neil to take care of himself,” chuckled
Grandma.</p>

<p class='c009'>The peace of the hot afternoon, murmurous with
bees, descended again upon the side-yard. Jacqueline’s
eyes were thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And did that all happen really right here in
Longmeadow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as sure as you’re a-sitting in that hammock,
Jackie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me some more about those old times—ah,
please do!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not now, Jackie. Sun’s getting low and I must
mix up a batch of Johnny-cake for supper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a sigh Grandma began to fold away the
little overalls that she had not yet finished patching.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me make the Johnny-cake,” Jacqueline offered
suddenly. “I did it day before yesterday, and
you telling me what to do. Let me try it alone!
Please!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Grandma considered for a second.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The receipt is all written out in the brown book
back of the clock,” she said. “Mind you flour the
pan after you’ve greased it, and don’t be too lavish
with the sugar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will—I won’t,” Jacqueline made two promises
almost in one breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>In her worn sneakers (Caroline’s sneakers!) she
flashed away into the big, tidy kitchen. Corn-meal
in the big tin, eggs and butter from the cool cellar.
Milk in the blue and white pitcher. Sugar in the
brown crock. She was going to cook! At school,
in cooking class, in a neat ruffled apron, with aluminum
and white-enamel bowls, and spoons of approved
pattern, she had made apricot-whip and
fudge. But now in the Conway kitchen, with
a yellow mixing bowl and an iron spoon, she really
made something that her family would like to eat,
and she sang joyously as she measured and stirred.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had two big pans of Johnny-cake in the oven
that she had craftily heated, and she wasn’t looking
at them more than twice every five minutes, when
the family began to gather. First came Nellie, leading
Freddie, and asking if supper wasn’t most ready,
and Jacqueline, quite as if she ran the house, so important
she now felt, told Nellie to wash her hands
and Freddie’s, too, before she thought of supper.
Then came Grandma, to take up Annie and freshen
her against mealtime, and then the family Ford
came gallantly into the yard, and here were Aunt
Martha and Neil, back from Baring Junction, with
three sacks of grain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Aunt Martha!” Jacqueline bounded to meet
her. “Supper’s ready, and I made the Johnny-cake
all alone, and fixed the oven by myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And do you know, Caroline with her party in
prospect, felt no happier than Jacqueline felt, when
tired, dusty Aunt Martha (who wasn’t her aunt!)
smiled at her and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, of all things! You got the supper yourself?
You spelled Grandma? I guess my bones
were all right, Jackie, when they said you were the
sort that would be a real little helper in the house.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c010'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />THE PRICE OF TEMPER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>But all the days at the Conway farm were not
like the day that ended in a blaze of glory, with
praises and hot Johnny-cake. No more than a week
later there came a day when everything went
crooked.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps Jacqueline got out of bed on the wrong
foot. Perhaps she was thinking too much of a pile
of story papers, which she had unearthed in the shed
chamber, and too little of her work. Perhaps it
was simply that she had grown tired of the rôle of
Caroline—even of a virtuous Caroline, who was a
help and comfort in the house, and bossed the
younger children.</p>

<p class='c009'>At any rate Jacqueline dawdled and shuffled
through her work, and complained constantly of the
heat. It was a hot day, true enough, but as Grandma
said, talking about the weather only made a bad
matter ten times worse. Let <i>it</i> alone, and likely it
would let <i>you</i> alone!</p>

<p class='c009'>But Jacqueline groaned and grumbled, and finally
lay down on the dining room couch (with a story
paper!) and gave herself up to being uncomfortable.
Presently she fell to thinking of the
Gildersleeve place, and the big, cool, dim rooms that she
knew such a roof must cover, and the white porcelain
tub, with lots of hot water, and a maid to wash
the tub when you stepped out of it. She began to
think that she had treated Caroline very generously,
and treated herself very badly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dinner was a horrid meal—pickled codfish in
white sauce, cold peas from last night’s supper,
slabs of home-made bread, molasses cookies, and
cottage cheese. The room was hot, and the boys
were sweaty and tired. Freddie upset a mug of
milk, and Neil fussed about the heat, and said his
head ached. Jacqueline was quite disgusted that he
should be so babyish.</p>

<p class='c009'>After dinner Aunt Martha insisted upon Grandma’s
lying down in her room. Grandma looked
“tuckered out,” and no wonder, for she had been
step-stepping all the morning, while Jacqueline
loafed. Of course, Jacqueline told her uneasy conscience,
she would have helped, if Grandma had
asked her. But you know, it is easier sometimes for
a tired old woman to do things herself than to ask
a sulky and unwilling little girl to do them for her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha sent Nellie off into the barn with
the babies. She was to be sure that they did not
disturb Grandma. Ralph and Dickie went back to
the fields, and Aunt Martha herself drove off to
Northford, to see a man who owed her money that
she very much needed. Jacqueline was left face to
face with the dinner dishes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, Neil,” she said bossily. “I’m not
going to wrassle these alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I gotta headache,” Neil answered, from the
couch that Jacqueline coveted. “I don’t have to
work this afternoon. Mother said so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She meant work in the fields. She didn’t mean
the dishes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She did, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She didn’t, neither. Get up, you great, lazy
boy, and help me. You ought to be ashamed of
yourself, making such a fuss about the weather.
You let <i>it</i> alone, and likely it’ll let <i>you</i> alone. Come
on now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t!” said Neil.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline’s face flamed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then the dishes will stay right there till Aunt
Martha comes,” she said. “I won’t touch ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t!” mocked Neil, and settled himself more
comfortably.</p>

<p class='c009'>Well, Jacqueline didn’t touch those dishes! If
you’ll believe it, she took her story papers and went
out and read in the hammock for two mortal hours,
while the dinner table stood just as the family had
left it, and the stockings in Grandma’s basket cried:
“Come darn me!” and patient little Nellie struggled
all alone to keep two hot and fussy babies amused
and quiet.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the old papers Jacqueline found a continued
story of the sort she liked, about a girl who went
to a boarding school, where most of the teachers
were mean and malicious and incredibly stupid;
about the pranks that she and her friends played,
and the mystery of a buried treasure that she
solved. Jacqueline was so deep in the mystery that
she scarcely heeded when Aunt Martha drove into
the yard. She came out of the treasure vault with a
jump, only when she heard her name called. Then
she looked, and saw Aunt Martha standing in the
kitchen doorway.</p>

<p class='c009'>Full of the spirit of her heroine, who put tyrannical
teachers in their place, Jacqueline rose and went
into the kitchen. She was almost eager for “a scene.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why aren’t those dishes done?” Aunt Martha
asked directly. Her shrewd gray eyes went right
through Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was drama with a vengeance. Jacqueline’s
heart began to beat fast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There were so many of ’em, and the day was
so hot, and I had a headache, and Neil wouldn’t
help,” she poured out all her reasons glibly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You leave Neil out. I’ll attend to him. It was
your job to clear up the dining room, and wash those
dishes. Go about it now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline turned slowly toward the dining room
door, but as she turned she said aloud, with a toss
of her head:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t <i>have</i> to!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked round to make sure that Aunt Martha
heard her, for Aunt Martha had a way of not always
hearing saucy and hateful speeches.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you stay in this house,” said Aunt Martha,
as she unpinned her cheap hat, “you’ll have to do
your share, like all the rest of us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, maybe I won’t stay in your old house,”
Jacqueline told her superbly. “There are better
places I can go to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” said Aunt Martha easily. “Trot
along—only get those dishes done before you
start.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That was too bad of Aunt Martha, for in the
rôle of tyrant, which Jacqueline had thoughtfully
assigned her, she ought to have lost her temper at
Jacqueline’s threat, instead of turning it into a kind
of joke. Since Aunt Martha kept her temper,
Jacqueline lost hers. She snatched the tray from
its shelf with unnecessary clatter, and she went into
the dining room, and banged it down hard on the
table. She began to pile the soiled dishes upon it,
helter-skelter, with as much noise as if she were a
raw Polish girl, just out of the onion fields.</p>

<p class='c009'>Neil turned a flushed face toward her, where he
lay on the couch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell-tale!” he softly sang.</p>

<p class='c009'>The justice of the taunt made it sting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re a slacker,” Jacqueline retorted promptly.
“Everybody hates a slacker. I was going to give
you a birthday present, and something perfectly
scrumptious at Christmas, but I never will now—never—never!”</p>

<p class='c009'>To emphasize the threat, she banged down the
heavy milk pitcher on the tray, without noticing
that the tray overhung the edge of the table perilously.
There was a tilt—a sickening slide and
crash—then plates, glasses, broken food, spilled
milk lay all in a mess at Jacqueline’s feet, and
among the débris, shattered to bits, were the two
green-dragon cups and saucers of thin china.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline felt the anger ooze out of her. She
stared at the wreckage, conscience-smitten. Neil
sat up and looked at her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve done it now!” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t care!” Jacqueline flung at him the first
words that came. She had to say something, or she
would have burst out crying.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Caroline!” spoke Aunt Martha’s voice. She
stood there in the room, with her tanned face really
white round the lips. “Don’t tell me you’ve gone
and broken Grandma’s cups!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing but two old cups!” Jacqueline almost
sobbed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha did not seem to hear her. She
went down on her knees and groped among the
fragments for bits of the shattered green-dragon
china. Her hands fairly shook as she gathered
them up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are all that was left of her wedding china,”
she said, more to herself than to the startled
children. “We ought not to have used them common—but
she didn’t relish her tea in a thick cup—and
she wouldn’t drink from china while I drank
out of kitchen ware. No, I can’t mend ’em, ever.
They’re smashed to smithereens.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t care—I don’t care!” Jacqueline screamed
across the awful lump in her throat that was choking
her. “I hate this house—and I hate you all—and
I’m never coming back again!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She called back the last words from the kitchen
doorway, and next moment she was out in the yard,
headed for the road, and running, as if for her
very life, to the Gildersleeve place, and the Gildersleeve
relations, and the identity of Jacqueline that
now, with all her heart, she wanted to get back
again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c010'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />ACCORDING TO AGREEMENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>By the time that Jacqueline had had her cry out,
she was nearly a mile on her way to Longmeadow
Street. Her eyes were smarting, and her
nose was sore, and her throat felt hot like a furnace.
When she came to the boundary brook between
Kaplinsky’s lease and Deacon Whitcomb’s field, she
was glad to stop and bathe her face and quiet the
jumping pulses in her wrists with cool water. She
smoothed her hair, too, with her wet fingers, and she
even took off her shabby sneakers and washed her
dusty feet and ankles. After all, she didn’t want to
arrive at the Gildersleeve place looking worse than
she had to.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now that she was refreshed, she trudged on more
slowly. She realized that she was tired out with
the wild pace at which she had run, and with the
scene in Aunt Martha’s dining room, which she
winced to remember. Wasn’t she thankful that she
really wasn’t Caroline, and that she needn’t ever
go back to the Conway farm? How could she
have faced them—Aunt Martha, and Neil, and
Grandma? Poor Grandma, whose precious cups
she had broken!</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the tears started to Jacqueline’s eyes. She
brushed them angrily away. She didn’t need to cry.
Wasn’t she going to send Grandma some new cups—the
thinnest cups she could buy in Boston—a
dozen cups—a whole dinner set? That would make
everything all right again.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time she came in sight of the first outlying
houses of the village, she had added to the dinner
set for Grandma an embroidered cap for Annie, a
doll with real hair for Nellie, a belt with a silver
buckle for Ralph, a camera for Dickie, and a choo-choo
train for Freddie.</p>

<p class='c009'>With great effort, as she entered the village, she
finally added to the collection a big, soft, luscious
rug for Aunt Martha’s car, and a magic-lantern for
Neil—not one of the little dinky toys that get out
of order, but the real thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the people at the farm got all those gifts,
she rather guessed they’d change their minds about
her. Perhaps they’d be sorry then that they hadn’t
been more considerate. How they would regret her—and
admire her! Maybe she’d go out there once
more—just once more—in her wine-colored jumper
dress that she liked, and take a big box of sweets to
the children. She fairly swelled out her chest, in her
dusty Peggy Janes, as she pictured herself playing
Lady Bountiful. But when she thought of Grandma,
her chest flattened again, just like a toy balloon
when you prick it and the air runs out. Oh, she
did want to get that dinner set right away! Her
eyes filled every time when she thought of Grandma,
sitting down to supper, and drinking her tea patiently
from the thick, ugly, crockery cup.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun had just dipped behind the western hills
across the river, when Jacqueline came to a halt outside
the box-hedge that enclosed the Gildersleeve
place. She had thought all along that she would
walk right up to the front door, and knock, and ask
for Mrs. Gildersleeve, and simply say to her:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aunt Eunice, I am Jacqueline. Call the little
girl who’s staying here, and she’ll tell you it’s just
so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But now that the moment for action had come,
she hesitated. To do it that way seemed not quite
fair to Caroline. Like stealing a march on her.
Really she must see Caroline, and tell her what was
up, before she gave away the trick that they had
played upon the Gildersleeves and the Conways.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not that Caroline won’t be as glad as me to have
it over with,” Jacqueline tried to quiet an uneasy
something within her. “She must be fed up by this
time on that old piano.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A little path, as narrow as a cat track, ran between
the Gildersleeve hedge and the rose tangle that
bounded the Trowbridge lawn. Jacqueline knew all
about that path, and a few others. She hadn’t come
into the village with that born rover, Neil, for
nothing. She slipped up this path in the shadows
that were cool and dark, and she quickly found the
gap in the hedge for which she was looking. She
wriggled through it, with some damage to the Peggy
Janes (Caroline’s Peggy Janes!) and there she was
in the garden, among the flowers that were already
half asleep. She peered about her eagerly. If only
Caroline would come that way! Then she spied the
summer house, and stole to the doorway that gaped
beneath the over-hanging vines, and peered in.</p>

<p class='c009'>The summer house was empty. The tea table
was folded up, and the wicker chairs set trimly in
place against another day. Under one of the chairs
a bit of clear orange color caught Jacqueline’s eye.
She pounced upon it, and found it was a little doll-smock
of orange, cross-stitched in dark blue. This
must belong to Mildred, and no doubt Mildred’s
careful little mother (“fussy,” Jacqueline called
her) would find it missing and come to look for it.
Why, things couldn’t have fallen out better for her!</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline sat down on the bench that ran round
the wall inside the summer house, and waited with
what patience she could scare up. She could see a
bit of the house through the elms that stood round
it—a gleam of white clapboards, that caught the
last light of the afterglow, a green shutter, a window
like an anxious eye. She wondered if that were
the window of the room that should be hers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she saw a little girl in a leaf brown dress
come from behind a clump of shrubbery and head
toward the summer house, with eyes bent upon the
path, as if she looked for something. Caroline, in
the name of all that was lucky! Gurgling with mischief,
Jacqueline drew back and waited in the shadows
that now were quite thick in the summer house.
She didn’t have to wait long. Framed in the doorway,
Caroline stood before her, dainty in Jacqueline’s
leaf brown smock with orange stitching, and
Jacqueline’s amber beads, and with a soft sparkle in
her face, which came from thoughts of pleasant
things that had happened and pleasant things to
come.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Boo!” cried Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline gave a little squeak, and clutched the
side of the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be scared, goose!” bade Jacqueline, stepping
forward. “It’s only me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline’s pale little hands fluttered to her throat
as if she wanted to push off something that choked
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Y-yes,” she stammered. “H-hello, Jackie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That was all Caroline said. She didn’t help
Jacqueline one bit, though she must have known
that Jacqueline hadn’t come there simply to say:
“Hello!” She just clung to the side of the door
and stared like somebody who expects to be hit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not a ghost,” said Jacqueline, impatiently.
“Don’t look at me like that. I just came over to
say I’ve had enough of the farm, and if you don’t
mind, we’ll swap back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” she agreed, in a dry little whisper. “All
r-right, Jackie.” Then she slid into the seat by the
door, just as if her legs had folded up under her,
and she hid her face in her hands and began to cry.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />AN HOUR TO TRY THE SOUL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>What do you suppose Prince Edward would
have done, if Tom Canty hadn’t wished to be
Tom Canty any more? Suppose that Tom, instead
of being a well-mannered little English boy, willing
to keep his proper station, had cried out at the mere
thought of going back to the foulness and cruelty
of Offal Court, and insisted, not unnaturally, perhaps,
that he preferred to be comfortable in a
palace?</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline had never thought of this possibility,
when she read “The Prince and the Pauper,” nor
when she tried to translate the story into modern
terms. But she faced it now in deep dismay, as she
looked at Caroline, sobbing her heart out, there in
the dusk of the summer house.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment Jacqueline shifted her weight from
one foot to the other, and hardly knew what to do.
But she was not in the habit of being turned from a
purpose, once her mind was made up, and her mind
was very much made up to sleep that night at the
Gildersleeve place. So down she sat beside the
weeping Caroline, and laid a hard little sunburnt
hand upon her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be a baby, Carol,” she said, quite fiercely,
because she didn’t want to let herself pity Caroline.
“You know you <i>said</i> you’d change, the minute I
wanted to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline nodded the little dark head that was
bowed desolately upon her hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then!” said Jacqueline, in an injured tone.
“What <i>are</i> you crying about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>(What, indeed?)</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline lifted her face and smeared her eyes
with her hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When—when shall we—change?” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” said Jacqueline bluntly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Jacqueline remembered something that all
her life she had wanted to forget—the look in the
eyes of Aunt Edie’s little lap dog, when she had
struck him. Of course Jacqueline had been just a
tiny thing—only four years old. It was right after
her father died. And she had been jealous of the
wee dog, because he had sat on Aunt Edie’s knee
sometimes when she wanted that place herself. So
one day when she found him alone and he turned to
her for a caress, she had slapped him—hard. She
gave him sugar afterward, and the cushions from
her best doll-buggy, and velvet-soft caresses, and
tears of penitence. But she had never forgotten the
look in his eyes when she struck him, and she saw
that look now in the tear-drenched eyes that Caroline
turned upon her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Jackie! No! Not now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’ll be dished,” said Jacqueline. The
words don’t do justice to the disgust in her tone.
There was no doubt that she did hate a quitter!</p>

<p class='c009'>But Caroline was past heeding even Jacqueline’s
scorn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Jackie!” she pleaded, and suddenly she
caught Jacqueline’s hands and clung to them.
“Can’t you wait just a little longer—only till to-morrow
night? I won’t ask anything more, Jackie—I
won’t even ask God for anything more—and
I’ll give up the piano—and your lovely clothes—I
haven’t hurt ’em, I’ve been awful careful—and I
won’t cry one little bit, even if there <i>are</i> cows at
the farm—and I’ve been so happy here—I didn’t
know things could be so lovely—I didn’t know
people could be so happy—oh, it will be like a beautiful
dream, all the rest of my life—only let me have
to-morrow, Jackie—please, please let me have to-morrow!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ouch!” said Jacqueline. “Stop digging your
finger nails into my hands!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline didn’t seem to hear her. She clung like
a limpet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only wait till to-morrow!” she sobbed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now you needn’t think,” snapped Jacqueline,
“that I’m going to hoof it three miles back to that
nasty old farm, and sleep in that hot, stuffy room.
What’s the dif. anyway between to-night and to-morrow,
I should like to know?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it’s my party,” wailed Caroline. “To-morrow
is my party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline snorted. Don’t blame her too much!
She had had a birthday party every year of her life,
and a Hallowe’en party, and an Easter-egg rolling,
and a Washington’s Birthday party, besides always
a group of children to eat ice-cream and see the fireworks
at Buena Vista on the Fourth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s a party?” she said, with contempt that
was quite sincere. No party, she felt, could give
Caroline sufficient pleasure to counterbalance the
discomfort she herself must suffer, if she had to go
back to the farm now—with her tail between her
legs, as she put it!—and face Aunt Martha.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are seven girls coming,” Caroline panted
out the details between her sobs. “I almost know
Eleanor Trowbridge next door—we smile at each
other always—and the table is to be out here in
the garden—and the ice-cream is coming from Boston
on the train. Oh, Jackie, shapes of ice-cream
like flowers—the sort you see sometimes in windows—red
roses and green leaves and everything—I
picked ’em out myself! And there are little cakes,
like frogs and white m-mice—with almonds for
ears! And we’re going to have a peanut-hunt—and
prizes—such scrumptious prizes—silver bangles,
and the cunningest little bottles of perfume, and dear
little carved Italian boxes with pictures in the
covers. Oh, Jackie, it’s like ten Christmases all
come together—and I—I never had a party before
in all my life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She let go of Jacqueline then. She had to use her
hands to hide her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline sat quite still. She was very angry
with Caroline for being such a baby. She was too
angry to speak to her. At least she supposed that
was the reason she kept silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Muzzy and I used to plan how I’d have a party,”
Caroline quavered in the dusk that was now thickening
fast in the summer house. “It’s the next
best fun to having things. I <i>almost</i> had a party
once. But the Stetson twins’ father lost his money
and they didn’t pay Muzzy for the music lessons—weeks
and weeks of lessons—so she couldn’t afford
a party—and I said I didn’t care, but oh! I did.
And now I was going to have a party—like in a
book—and I’ll never have another chance the longest
day I live. Oh, Jackie—Jackie! Couldn’t
you——”</p>

<p class='c009'>She didn’t finish the sentence. She just let it trail
off hopelessly into the dusk.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline felt a queer tingling in her palms, and
a hot smarting behind her eyes. She was <i>mad</i>—mad
at Caroline—mad at herself—mad at something
in herself that was going to make her do what
Caroline wanted, and hate herself afterward for
doing it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Like taking candy off a kid!” That was her
new Uncle Jimmie’s phrase for something that was
<i>too</i> contemptible for a regular fellow to do. That
was what it would be to take Caroline’s party away
from her. Let her have her old party! But drat
Caroline—and double-drat Prince Edward, whose
silly story had let her in for this! Trouble! <i>He</i>
didn’t know the name of trouble!</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline drew a deep breath, which was rather
like a sniffle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aw shucks!” she said disgustedly. “Cut out the
sob-stuff, Carol. One day is as good as another,
far as <i>I’m</i> concerned. You can <i>have</i> your party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline, all moist and crumpled, fell upon her
in the dusk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Jackie! You mean it—really? You are
the dearest——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dumb-bells!” scoffed Jacqueline. “Stop
bawling now. You’ll look like a squashed egg. I tell
you, it’s all right, and you can have your party. So
long, now! I’ve got to beat it home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She rose, and with a lofty air, patterned on what
she thought Uncle Jimmie would do in similar circumstances,
she strode toward the gap in the hedge.
Honestly she tried to whistle as she went. But just
as she reached the gap, Caroline came pattering out
of the dusk and clutched her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now don’t go and begin all over again!” Jacqueline
scolded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please, Jackie!” Caroline’s teeth fairly chattered.
“I shan’t let you—it isn’t fair—it’s <i>your</i>
party really—it’s <i>you</i> Cousin Penelope meant it
for—and I—I didn’t tell you all about it. I was afraid
you <i>couldn’t</i> give it up—if I told you everything.
There’ll be little satin boxes of candy on the table,
one for each of us—and darling little dolls, with
baskets of nuts—one apiece—to keep—and birds
that hold the place-cards—and oh, Jackie, a pie full
of presents! You pull a string, each of you, and
then——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, g’on!” said Jacqueline. “A Jack Horner
Pie. I’m fed up on ’em—had ’em since I was knee-high
to a hopper toad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” gasped Caroline, softly, incredulously.</p>

<p class='c009'>All in a minute, a self-revealing minute such as
she had seldom known, there flooded over Jacqueline
the realization of all that she had had and
taken for granted—all that this other little girl had
never known, and valued all the more. She was not
angry with Caroline any longer. She felt that she
was sorrier for her than she had ever been for anybody,
and then suddenly she knew that she loved
Caroline, poor, little, sobbing Caroline, whom she
had it in her power to lift into a heaven of happiness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t go and eat too much at your old party,”
Jacqueline bade gruffly. “Now don’t hang on to me
like that. I gotta go. And I guess I won’t come
back for quite a while.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But to-morrow——” Caroline hesitated. A hope
that she was ashamed of trembled in her voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was fooling when I said we’d swap,” snapped
Jacqueline. “I’m not coming to-morrow. I’m not
coming <i>near</i> this mean old place till I have to. You
hear me? I <i>like</i> it at the farm. I’m going to <i>stay</i>
there till Aunt Edie comes, if she doesn’t come till
next Christmas. And you can just <i>stay</i> here till
you’re dead sick of it—the old piano—and starched
people—and prunes and prisms and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, oh! Do you <i>mean</i> that?” Caroline’s cry
was sheer rapture. “But I couldn’t let——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps her honest protest would have moved
Jacqueline to recall the promise she had so rashly
made. But just at that moment a clear, imperious
voice called: “Jacqueline!” and when both little
girls pivoted at that name, they saw a figure, in soft
white summer clothes, come into the dusky garden.
It was Cousin Penelope, and by the way in which
she headed straight down the path toward the spot
where they stood, they knew that she had spied
them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />PENELOPE TAKES ALARM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Like the hero of the old music hall song,
Jacqueline felt that “now was the time for disappearing.”
I wish I could say to her credit that
she fled, simply because she was afraid that if she
came face to face with Cousin Penelope, she would
be tempted beyond her strength and withdraw the
promise she had so impulsively made to Caroline.
As a matter of fact, I suspect that she ran away,
because she had had enough drama with Aunt
Martha and Caroline to satisfy even her drama-loving
soul for at least one day. At any rate, she
dove out of the garden through the narrow gap in
the hedge, like a scared and nimble rabbit, and
Caroline was left to face alone the onslaught of
Cousin Penelope.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course Caroline ought to have been just as
noble as Jacqueline. She ought to have called
Jacqueline back, and presented her to Cousin
Penelope as her really, truly little kinswoman, and
then for her own part subsided gracefully into the
company of the cows and the awful boy-cousins, just
as Tom Canty was willing to go back to rags and dirt
and misery.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Caroline thought of the party, and the darling
little doll-favors. Sweet little Watteau gowns they
wore, of figured silk, with their powdered hair piled
high and topped with wee, beribboned hats of straw
that would have turned a fairy green with envy.
Caroline thought, too, of the look that would come
into Cousin Penelope’s pale, stern face, when she
knew that it was upon a little cheat that she had
wasted kindness, and music lessons, and dentistry!
No, Caroline hadn’t the courage to tell the truth.
She just stood there, dumb and trembling, while
Cousin Penelope bore down upon her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jacqueline!” Cousin Penelope’s voice, as she
spoke to Caroline, was sharp with what an older person
would have recognized as anxiety. “Who was
that child you were talking with?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mercy, what a chance to tell the truth—the whole
dramatic truth—in a dramatic manner! But
Caroline, like Jacqueline on several occasions, told
half a truth which, like many a half-truth, was as
deceptive as a good, big whopper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A—a little girl,” she stammered. “She lives
down in the Meadows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Through the dusk she could almost feel Cousin
Penelope bristle, like a lady-dog when rough
strangers come too near her precious young.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That bold, forward Conway child? Of all the
audacity! What brought her prowling into our
garden?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She—she wanted to—see me,” faltered Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To see you!” echoed Cousin Penelope. “Why
should she <i>dream</i> of associating with you, Jacqueline?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bewildered and badgered, Caroline knew that she
must say <i>something</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We—we were on the train—coming from Chicago,”
she said in a voice that see-sawed, though
she tried hard to keep it steady. “We played together—with
Mildred. Oh, she’s a nice little girl,
Cousin Penelope, honest, she is—you’d like her—she’s
nicer than me—ever so much so!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She had thought she hadn’t a tear left in her,
but now she began to cry again, not noisily, but in
soft little tired gasps. Oh, how was it that clinging
heroines in books always managed to swoon?
She wished that <i>she</i> could swoon, then and there,
and so escape from everything. She couldn’t bear
to have Cousin Penelope ask her even one more
question.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Cousin Penelope stopped questioning.
Amazingly she put her arm round Caroline’s tense
little shoulders, and dabbed her eyes gently with
her filmy handkerchief, which smelt like a breeze
over beds of violets.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, there!” she said. “You mustn’t make
your eyes red, on the night before your party. You
must have forgotten the party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Forgotten the party! If only Cousin Penelope
guessed!</p>

<p class='c009'>They went back together through the dusky,
fragrant garden. Cousin Penelope urged Caroline
to look at the little pale stars, which were coming
out now almost as fast as you could count them in
the sky, that was the color of tarnished old silver.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be a fine day to-morrow,” Penelope told
Caroline. “You don’t realize, you little Californian,
how we have to study the sky, here in New
England, when we plan to give a garden-party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she talked about the dress that Caroline
should wear at the party, and the way in which
the flowers should be arranged on the table. She
was talking to take Caroline’s mind off the scene
with the rude little girl from the Conway farm.
Caroline saw through her strategy, but she was
grateful to her, just the same. She only hoped that
Aunt Eunice wouldn’t see her red eyes, and have
to be told about what had happened in the garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>Better than Caroline had dared to hope, they
found Aunt Eunice seated on the wide, cool porch,
where it was now too dark for features to be distinguished.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This little girl is running up to bed,” said
Cousin Penelope blithely. “We must get our
beauty sleep before the party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thankful for this way of escape, Caroline kissed
Aunt Eunice good-night and trotted upstairs, to
bathe her face and her smarting eyes. How good
it was that Aunt Eunice didn’t suspect!</p>

<p class='c009'>At that moment Aunt Eunice, on the dim, cool
porch, was saying in a troubled voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s wrong, Penelope? The little thing had
been crying. Her cheeks were quite wet. She isn’t—homesick?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not in the least!” replied Penelope, in a crisp
voice that defied the whole tribe of Delanes and the
entire state of California. “Why should she be
homesick, here with <i>us</i>?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was she crying about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Such an annoying little incident, Mother. A
child that is staying at the Conways’ scraped acquaintance
with Jacqueline on the train and has
been trying to force herself upon her ever since. I
found her just now with Jacqueline in the garden.
She ran away, you may be sure, as soon as I appeared.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A child from the Meadows?” exclaimed Aunt
Eunice. “Why, she is ever so far from home, and
it’s dark.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Penelope didn’t seem to think that fact of any
importance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor little Jacqueline is too young to know how
to handle such an awkward situation,” she went on.
“She’s Gildersleeve through and through, Mother.
Loyal and affectionate. You should have heard her
stand up for the horrid little pushing creature, because
she thought her a friend. I must find some
way myself to put a stop to such intrusions. I wonder
if I’d better speak to the Conway woman? She
seems very sensible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Martha Conway is the salt of the earth,” said
Aunt Eunice, with conviction. “You ought to
know, Penelope. You went to public school with
her once upon a time. After all, why shouldn’t
this child come play with Jacqueline?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Penelope spoke loftily, as she occasionally did
speak to her mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Mother dearest, just for the sake of your
democratic theories we can’t let Jack’s daughter
associate with every common child that pushes itself
forward. Blood will tell, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Aunt Eunice, with mild persistence,
“but what’s wrong with the Conway blood, Penelope?
Conways and Gildersleeves and Holdens
and Taits and Trowbridges, they all came here together
in the old days—God-fearing farmer-folk,
the lot of them, and not much to choose among
them, though some have prospered lately more than
others.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Penelope became indulgent. There wasn’t much
else for her to do, if she was to retire gracefully
from the argument.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re a darling old radical, Mother,” she said.
“It’s fortunate that <i>I</i> am here to protect Jacqueline.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice sighed. She frequently did sigh at
the end of one of her conversations with Penelope
that never seemed to get them anywhere. She rose
to her feet and gathered up her thin scarf of silk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I’ll go up to my room,” she said. “I’ve
a telephone call to send.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Penelope was left alone, victorious, if you
please to call it so. She wasn’t quite sure. Indeed,
to herself she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother is provoking. If she really is going to
take that view of the case, I must act with decision.
For, mother or no mother, I’m going to head off
any acquaintance between Jacqueline and that rough
child from the Meadows, even if I have to alter all
our summer plans to do it.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />THROUGH THE DARKNESS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>All unconscious of Cousin Penelope’s musings,
Caroline stretched herself in the fresh cool
bed, in her pretty room. She thought of the party
next day, and all the lovely days, brimful of music
and happiness, that were to follow. For Jackie
had promised that she should stay there undisturbed
at The Chimnies, until Aunt Edie came at the end of
summer.</p>

<p class='c009'>How kind Jackie was, and how good, and how
brave! She wasn’t afraid of cows, or Cousin Penelope,
or boys, or the dark. Caroline, for instance,
would have been frightened to death to go the three
miles in the black night down into the Meadows.
But Jackie had just whistled and walked away, as
unconcerned as anything. No, there was no one in
the world so good or so brave as Jackie. With
that worshiping thought uppermost in her mind,
Caroline fell asleep, as safe and sheltered as care
and love could make her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meantime the brave Jackie, with her heart in her
throat, was making the best of her way through the
vast blackness of the onion fields, back to the Conway
farm.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first of the walk wasn’t so bad. On
Longmeadow Street she met people, by ones and twos and
threes, on their way to prayer meeting or to the
Post Office. She could see, too, the light from
house windows that streamed across the broad, well-tended
lawns. She enjoyed the luxury of pitying
herself, all alone in the dark, with no one to care,
while other children, in those lighted houses, were
being tucked up in bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>But after she left the last houses of the village,
Jacqueline stopped enjoying the drama of the situation
which she had chosen. The fields stretched
round her endlessly. The sky was black as despair,
and all stuck with stars that were sharp as screams
of rage. The edges of the sky were tucked in behind
the coal black mountains, from which the Indians
in old days used to swoop down upon the
settlement.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline caught her breath, and looked hurriedly
over her shoulder. Of course there were no
Indians nowadays. They couldn’t be lurking that
moment in the fields. The onions grew too low to
hide an ambuscade. It was only the wind that made
their tops rustle in a queer way that pumped the
blood out of her heart and set it throbbing against
her ear-drums.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one could hide in the onion fields, she knew.
But in the little gullies where the brooks flowed that
drained the fields—that was a different matter.
Every time she drew near a culvert, she ran as fast
as she could upon her tired legs, through the heavy
dust, until the danger point was passed. Even if
there weren’t any Indians, there were Polish field-hands.
Good, honest men, most of them, Aunt
Martha maintained. But some of them were worthless
and drunken. There was a half-witted Kaplinsky
boy, too, who sometimes chased younger
children, with horrid, half-articulate threats.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline sheered into the middle of the dark
gray road to avoid the patch of inky shadow that a
solitary elm tree threw halfway across it. She
wasn’t crying, as Caroline would have cried.
Jacqueline cried, as you may have discovered, only
when she was angry. Now her breath came thick
and strangling, and her legs felt weak, and there
were hot prickles of sweat on her temples, and cold
prickles on the back of her neck. But she didn’t cry!</p>

<p class='c009'>Some one was coming along the road behind her.
No mistake! She could hear voices—men’s voices.
On instinct she did what a moment before she
couldn’t have been hired to do. She scuttled off
the road and hid in the damp bed of the brook that
bounded the Whitcomb acres. There she crouched
with her head on her knees, until she heard steps
shuffle along the culvert. She peeped up fearfully.
Three figures of men were silhouetted against the
sky. They paused on the side of the culvert (fortunately!)
that was farthest from her, and spat
into the brook, and spoke to one another in a foreign
tongue, and laughed—ogreishly, as it seemed to
Jacqueline—and then walked on.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had actually gone. She could breathe
again. But she wouldn’t dare walk on for hours and
hours. They might loiter. She might overtake
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>For what seemed to her half the night, she
crouched in the clammy bed of the brook. Oh, she
thought to herself in those long, dreary minutes,
what a silly she had been! Why hadn’t she stepped
right up and told Cousin Penelope who she was?
Well, she couldn’t, because she had gone and
promised Caroline—a crazy promise—she hated
herself because she had made it—she knew she was
going to hate herself when she made it—just the
same a promise was a promise, and you kept it, even
though the sky fell.</p>

<p class='c009'>But why had she ever promised? It would be
dreadful at the farm now—but there wasn’t anywhere
else to go. Perhaps Aunt Martha would
send her to an Institution. She didn’t think any
longer that an Institution would be fun. She thought
of the workhouse boys in “Oliver Twist,” who
never had enough to eat—and she hadn’t eaten herself
now for ages and ages. She knew what hunger
was! Oh, she didn’t want to go to an Institution—and
she didn’t want to go to the farm—and she
couldn’t go to the Gildersleeves’, because she had
promised Caroline! Perhaps she’d better stay right
there in the ditch and die—and then wouldn’t everybody
be sorry!</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then she heard something rustling near her.
She didn’t stop to find out whether it was a harmless
field mouse, or a snake, equally harmless,
though perhaps less attractive. She didn’t stop for
anything. She scrambled out of that ditch and
started on a sore-footed run for the Conway farm.
Aunt Martha—Neil—<i>anything</i> rather than the
loneliness of the ditch upon a pitiless, black, Pole-infested
night!</p>

<p class='c009'>She was stumbling along the road, as she felt
that she had been stumbling for a lifetime, panting
and coughing as the dust that she kicked up got into
her nose, when she heard from before her the chug
and chatter of a laboring Ford. Nearer and
clearer, she caught the gleam of headlights that lit
up a fan-shaped space of dust and dark green onion
tops.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a second she halted in her tracks. Then she
reflected that people in cars can be as undesirable as
people on foot, and once more she plunged off the
road. This time she found no friendly ditch to hide
her. She just plumped down flat among the onion
tops and lay gasping.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Ford trundled past the spot where she had
left the road—stopped—began to back. Jacqueline
“froze,” like a scared little animal. Oh, <i>why</i>
couldn’t she wake up, and find that this was just a
horrible nightmare?</p>

<p class='c009'>Some one leaned out of the Ford.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jackie!” a voice called clearly and firmly. “Is
that you? Jackie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline found her feet, though a second before
she would have vowed she hadn’t enough strength
left ever to stand again. She flew, stiff-legged,
through the crumbly dust and the strong-smelling
onion tops, into the road. She cast herself upon
the running board, she flung herself into the seat of
the car, and hung about the neck of the woman at
the steering wheel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Aunt Martha!” she cried. “Aunt Martha!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Martha Conway, if you’ll believe it, grabbed
that bad Jacqueline and hugged her just as tight as
if she were clean and sweet, instead of the dirtiest,
sweatiest, tiredest ragamuffin that ever crawled
penitently out of an onion bed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />NEVER AGAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps blood doesn’t tell quite as much as
Cousin Penelope believed it did. Certainly
Jacqueline and Aunt Martha, who were no relation
to each other, were more alike than Caroline and
Aunt Martha could ever have been. So much alike
they were that almost instantly each drew back
into her own corner of the seat, as if they were
ashamed of the way in which they had clutched
each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha gave her attention to backing and
turning the Ford, with the least possible damage to
the lawless onions that overflowed into the highway.
Jacqueline leaned back in her seat and stretched her
tired legs and sighed with blissful relief. Neither
spoke till the car was safely headed homeward.
Then Jacqueline found her voice—such a meek
voice!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Were you—looking for me, Aunt Martha?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t think I’d be driving to the village at this
time of evening just for the fun of it, did you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a cool, clipped, everyday voice Aunt Martha
spoke in! Who would have dreamed to hear it that
she had hugged Jacqueline two minutes before?</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did you know—I’d gone to the village?
I might have been most anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shouldn’t have known where to look for you,
more’n if you’d been a needle in a haystack. I
<i>didn’t</i> look for you,” said Aunt Martha defensively.
“But when old Mrs. Gildersleeve called me up and
said you’d been seen up in the village——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Gildersleeve called up—about me?”
Jacqueline repeated stupidly. Aunt Eunice had
telephoned to Aunt Martha! Of all people! How
did she know? Why should she care?</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s an awful nice woman,” Aunt Martha said
warmly. “She’s the kind that’ll bow just as friendly
to old Si Whitcomb on his hay-rack as she does to
Judge Holden in his wire-wheeled car. She had to
call twice before she got me, ’cause that feather-headed
Williams girl on our party line was planning
with the minister’s youngest daughter how she’d dye
and turn and cut her last winter’s suit. I think they
made a batch of devil’s food, too, and settled the
reputations of half their neighbors before they got
off that line. I know, ’cause I was trying to put in a
call myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Was it about her, Jacqueline wondered? But she
decided it was best to ask no questions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Soon’s Mrs. Gildersleeve got me,” Aunt Martha
went on, “I thought I’d best start out on the chance
of meeting with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you very much,” Jacqueline murmured,
oh, so meekly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Was Aunt Martha going to scold her now, she
wondered? Well, perhaps it would be over before
they reached the farm. She waited in the silence
that grew worse and worse every minute, for every
minute she realized, with a deeper sense of guilt,
what a lot of trouble and anxiety she had given the
Conways. At last she just couldn’t stand it any
longer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aunt Martha,” she burst out, “<i>are</i> you going to
send me to an Institution?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha turned and stared at her through
the darkness. Jacqueline could see the whites of her
eyes under the brim of her ugly, cheap hat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A—what?” Aunt Martha asked sharply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Institution,” babbled Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, of all the—Whoever put such an idea
into your head?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline came pretty near saying: “Caroline!”
She remembered just in time that <i>she</i> was
Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cousin Delia said it,” she faltered. “She
seemed to think I’d go to an Institution—if you
didn’t want me—if I was a trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Delia Meade said that?” Aunt Martha’s voice
was positively fierce.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Um-m,” Jacqueline almost whimpered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well!” said Aunt Martha. “I must say! I
have my opinion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Evidently it was of Delia Meade that she had the
opinion. From the tone of her voice Jacqueline
hoped that Aunt Martha would never have that
sort of opinion of <i>her</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not a heathen, <i>I hope</i>!” said Aunt Martha.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline thought of a picture in one of her
travel books at home. In the picture some young
women with bushy hair, and bone earrings, and
wreaths of flowers round their necks, and not much
else in the way of covering, were dancing round a
huge stone image. Those were heathen, if you
please! Aunt Martha couldn’t be like them if she
tried for a hundred years. The mere thought of
Aunt Martha looking like that made Jacqueline
want to laugh. But she decided that she’d better
keep the joke to herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>They turned in presently at the Conway farm.
How quickly they had come, and what an endless
time it would have taken Jacqueline to cover the distance
on her smarting feet! Aunt Martha ran the
Ford into the barn, and with Jacqueline’s help closed
and padlocked the great clumsy doors. None of the
boys were there to help her. Why, it must be ever
so late!</p>

<p class='c009'>When they came into the kitchen, where a dim
lamp burned, Jacqueline saw by the hands of the
steeple-roofed kitchen clock that it was going on
eleven—a desperate hour for the Conway farm!
They had come in softly, but Grandma must have
been lying awake and listening for she called instantly
from her dark bedroom:</p>

<p class='c009'>“That you, Martha? Did you find her safe?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, Mother Conway,” Aunt Martha
spoke guardedly, so as not to waken Annie. Then
she whispered to Jacqueline! “Go in and say goodnight
to Grandma. It’ll be a load off her mind to
see you’re all right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline didn’t feel the least bit like laughing,
as she went a-tiptoe into the little bedroom off the
kitchen. She had been horrid, she realized. She
almost wished that Aunt Martha and Grandma had
been horrid and hateful and scolded her—yes, and
let her find her way home, all alone, in the awful
dark. If they had, she wouldn’t have needed to
feel so hot and ashamed as she felt now.</p>

<p class='c009'>She stole round Annie’s crib and paused at the
bedside. Grandma put out her hard old hand, with
its twisted knuckles, and caught at Jacqueline’s
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ye ain’t come to no harm, Jackie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Grandma,” whispered Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Tain’t like it used to be when I was young.
The Meadows ain’t the best place for little folks
to run about in after dark. Don’t ye do it again,
Jackie, ever!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The old voice was tremulous.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline dumbly stroked the hand that held
hers. She couldn’t seem to speak, yet she did so
want to say: “I’m sorry!” Wasn’t it odd that in all
her life she had never once been able to say those
two words? She couldn’t say them now, though her
throat was dry and her eyes were aching with tears
that she didn’t mean to shed. She pressed Grandma’s
hand hard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to get you some new cups.” That
was what she said at last. “Thin as egg-shells. I
didn’t mean to break yours. I—I won’t let you
work so hard to-morrow, Grandma.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, there, child! ’Course you didn’t mean to
break ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Their hands fell apart. Folks didn’t kiss and
cuddle much in the Conway household.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get yourself something to eat before you go to
bed, Jackie. I put some top-milk in the blue pitcher
for you, and left it in the cellar-way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Grandma.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s fresh raisin cookies, too, in the tin.
Good-night, Jackie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night, Grandma.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Very softly Jackie stole back into the kitchen.
She found Aunt Martha lighting the burner beneath
the big kettle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The water’ll be more than blood warm by the
time you’ve eaten,” said Aunt Martha. “Take a
pitcher full upstairs and wash your feet before you
get between the sheets. You’ll have to wash your
hair to-morrow. You look as if you’d burrowed
head first into a sand bank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline blushed, and wondered if Aunt
Martha would make any more near guesses at the
truth. But Aunt Martha made no further comments.
She busied herself in putting the cat
outside, and locking doors, and bolting windows.
Meantime Jacqueline fetched her cookies and her
pitcher of milk, and sat down at the kitchen table,
in the dim light of the one oil lamp, and ate and
drank, hungrily and thirstily. To look at her, you
wouldn’t have guessed that she wanted to say, “I’m
sorry!” But she did, and the dryness in her throat
took half the good taste out of the milk and the
cookies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aunt Martha!” she spoke suddenly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha paused in winding the clock, and
looked over her shoulder at Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to get Grandma some new cups,”
said Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>A smile that was quizzical and a little bit pitying
played round Aunt Martha’s lips. But all she said
was:</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the right idea. Get a box to-morrow and
put your pennies in it till you’ve saved enough. It’ll
take some time, but it’s no more than fair. Now
trot along and get some sleep while it’s cool. It’ll
be a clear, hot day to-morrow, or I miss my guess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And to-morrow was Caroline’s party! Suddenly
Jacqueline felt her crushed spirits revive, and her
dampened pride rekindle within her. If Aunt
Martha, and Grandma, and Aunt Eunice, too, had
all most unexpectedly been good to her, she at least
had evened up things a little by being good to Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad I didn’t quit,” Jacqueline told herself,
as she toiled up the stairs, dead tired, with her
pitcher of lukewarm water. “I’m glad I told
Caroline I’d stick it out here, and oh! I’m going
to be glad for all my life that I let the kid have her
old party.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXV' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br />ON A NIGHT OF TEMPEST</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The party was almost as wonderful as Caroline
expected it to be, so you may judge for yourself
that it was a very wonderful party indeed. The
caterer way down in Boston didn’t forget to send
the ices and the cakes, as Caroline in a private agony
had feared that he might, and Frank didn’t puncture
a tire or run into a ditch when he fetched them
from the train at Baring Junction. Eleanor Trowbridge,
the little girl next door, didn’t come down
with rash, as a subterranean rumor said that she
was coming, and Judge Holden’s youngest granddaughter
didn’t go into a tantrum and throw things,
as she did (according to gossipy Sallie) to the serious
disturbance of little Patty Wheeler’s Fourth of
July party.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline wore a frock (Jacqueline’s frock!) the
color of creamy honeysuckle, hand-made and hem-stitched,
with two rosettes of narrow black velvet
ribbon and gold tissue at the high waist line. Her
guests fluttered crisply in lavender and pale blue,
shell pink and lemon yellow. It was as if the posy
bed had come alive and found sweet, shrill voices in
which to talk and laugh and call across the scented
spaces.</p>

<p class='c009'>They hunted peanuts, and they played at grace-hoops
and ring-toss on the lawn, where the shadows
grew longer with the passing hours. Everybody won
a prize at something. They sat at the flower-decked
table, and ate the tiniest buttered rolls and creamed
chicken in little shells of pastry, ices that were so
lovely Caroline wished she could keep hers forever,
and cakes so good to the eye and the taste that they
just bewitched you into taking another and another.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then they played again among the shrubbery,
hide and seek, and run, sheep, run! You see, they
all felt very well acquainted now. They were much
noisier than they had been before the refreshments,
and the youngest Holden began to show off and turn
cart wheels.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our little girl has really the sweetest manners of
them all,” said Aunt Eunice, as she looked down
on the games from the shaded porch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She has more than manners,” Cousin Penelope
answered. “She has <i>manner</i>. But of course,” she
added proudly, “blood will always tell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The nicest party that ever was, the seven little
girls said, when they bade Aunt Eunice and Cousin
Penelope and Caroline good-night and asked Caroline
to come soon and play with them. But in Longmeadow
annals that red-letter day of Caroline’s life
was to be remembered, not as the date of Mrs.
William Gildersleeve’s grandniece’s party, but as
the date of the worst tempest that had swept
through the township in years.</p>

<a href='images/illus-02a.jpg'><img src='images/illus-02.jpg' alt='' class='ig002' /></a>
<p>“Jacqueline! It’s I. Cousin Penelope. Don’t be frightened.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Caroline waked in her bed just as a great cart-load
of rocks—or so it seemed to her—was dumped
upon the roof. She could see the furniture, the
hangings, the very pictures on the walls ghastly and
unfamiliar in the glare of what must be a gigantic
searchlight, which was shut off suddenly and left
the room in smothery, thick blackness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline ducked beneath the coverings and hugged
Mildred tight in her arms. A second crash shook
the bed beneath her—a second burst of flaming light
searched her out, even beneath the sheet and the
soft blanket. She thought she was going to die with
terror, when she heard a little faint click, and a
voice spoke right above her:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jacqueline! It’s I—Cousin Penelope. Don’t
be frightened!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hesitatingly, Caroline put aside the coverings and
sat up. The light on the little table at her bedside
had been switched on, and in the shaded brightness
stood Cousin Penelope. She wore a silk dressing-gown
of pale lavender, embroidered with clusters
of purple wistaria. Her hair hung in a long braid
at either side of her pale face. She looked gentler
than ever Caroline had known her or dreamed that
she could be. When she smiled, Caroline smiled
back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mildred was a little frightened,” said Caroline.
“I’m glad you came in, Cousin Penelope. Will you
stay—or does Aunt Eunice want you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother has lived through so many tempests that
she doesn’t mind them now,” said Cousin Penelope.
She drew up the low rocker and sat down. “I don’t
think they can be worse than your California earthquakes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My conscience! How Jacqueline would have resented
the suggestion that there were ever earthquakes
in California! But Caroline was too ignorant
of the proper attitude of a Native Daughter to
be indignant. She only held Mildred tighter and
gasped a little, as the room once more was irradiated
with white and awesome light. She looked gratefully
at Cousin Penelope.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t mind it much,” she quavered, “now that
you are here. It—it does make you think of poetry,
doesn’t it?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’The heavens are veined with fire,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the thunder—how it rolls!</div>
      <div class='line'>In the lulling of the storm——’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Down came another cartload on the roof, only
this time it didn’t sound like mere rocks, but like
metal rails.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ow!” squeaked Caroline. “Do you think that
hit anything? Of course I’m not frightened, but
Mildred is downright hectic.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope rose and pulled down the blinds,
and drew the chintz curtains across the windows.
The fearsome glare of the lightning was shut out,
but the thunder still thumped and thudded overhead.
Caroline was glad that when Cousin Penelope
sat down again, she drew the chair quite close to
the bedside.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s very comforting to have you here, Cousin
Penelope,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re company for each other, Jacqueline.
Now lie down and go to sleep again. I won’t leave
you till the storm is over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Caroline nestled down in her bed and closed
her eyes, and thought of her party. She opened her
eyes again, as the thunder crashed angrily, and saw
Cousin Penelope sitting in the soft lamplight, so
different from Cousin Penelope by day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I like you with your hair down, Cousin Penelope,”
Caroline said sleepily. “I wish you wore it
always that way. You are so pretty with your hair
down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope actually flushed, cheek and
throat, but she wasn’t angry, for her eyes were
smiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Caroline shifted Mildred in her arms, and
closed her eyes once more. Presently she realized
that there had been silence for a space that was long
enough to be felt—silence except for the roar of rain
upon the roof, and that was nothing to the anvil clang
of the thunder that for so long had deafened them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mildred is going to sleep,” said Caroline, without
opening her eyes. “She thinks the storm is most
over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The thunder rolled, but it was far away, like a
noise in dreams, and presently it was only in dreams,
for Caroline, that the thunder rolled. When she
opened her eyes again, there was no light in the
room, except the pale light that came from the rain-washed
out-of-doors. Against the night Cousin
Penelope’s form was outlined, as she finished putting
up the blinds and opening the windows. Then she
came softly across the room, in the fresh, sweet air
and bent and drew the coverlet over Caroline’s
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night, Cousin Penelope,” Caroline whispered
sleepily. “Go back to bed now—or you’ll
take cold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the darkness Cousin Penelope bent suddenly,
and the faint scent of violets came with her. She
kissed Caroline’s forehead, and Caroline put up her
arms, and caught her round the neck, and kissed her
cheek.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re so good, Cousin Penelope,” she whispered.
“I’m so glad you like me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment Cousin Penelope held her close.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I—like you, Jacqueline.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The naming of the name that was not hers made
Caroline shrink in the arms that held her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want you to like me always!” she cried from
her very heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Silly little girl!” Cousin Penelope whispered
tenderly—think of Cousin Penelope being tender!—and
kissed her again. Then she tucked her in
snugly, and bade her sleep, for the storm was over,
and went away.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Caroline lay wide awake, until the rain had
dwindled to the mere dribble of water from the
roof, and when she slept at last, her dreams were
troubled.</p>

<p class='c009'>For Jacqueline at that hour, there were no
dreams. All the first part of the night she had slept
soundly. She was really tired, for she had worked
hard all day, in an honest effort to make up for the
naughtiness of the day before, and to show that she
appreciated the way in which no one, not even Neil,
alluded to it. (Neil had actually come forward, and
offered to help wash the dinner dishes!)</p>

<p class='c009'>But when the first crash of thunder reverberated
from the eastern mountains to the hills across the
river, Jacqueline sat right up in bed. Where was
she? What was happening? A white blaze lit the
topsy-turvy baskets of roses on the wall-paper, so
that she clapped her hands to her eyes and thought
she was blind for life. Then she felt the clutch of
frightened little arms flung round her, and heard
Nellie sob:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Jackie! I’m so scared!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thunder can’t hurt you, goosey!” quavered
Jacqueline, with her arm pressed tight across her
eyes. The roof would fall upon their heads next
moment, she was sure. The whole house would go
up in a blaze of fire. Oh, why didn’t Aunt Martha
come to rescue them?</p>

<p class='c009'>But Aunt Martha didn’t come. Nobody came!
The thunder shook the roof beams. The lightning
sheathed the room in molten flame. Nellie sobbed,
and choked, and clung round Jacqueline’s neck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mammy! Mammy!” she gasped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep still!” Jacqueline scolded. “Your mother
isn’t coming—nobody’s coming—and <i>I’ve</i> got to
get up and shut those windows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, that was just what she must do. For the
rain, driven by the wind, was drenching their bed,
and doing nobody knew what damage besides. She
must get up—and she did get up! It wouldn’t do
ever to let Nellie think that ten years old could be
as scared as six years old.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline struggled with the windows that stuck,
while the rain soaked through her thin nightdress,
clear to her skin, and the thunder boomed in her
ears, and the lightning seemed aimed in all the universe
at her one poor little head. She remembered
every dreary story she had ever heard of people
killed by lightning. She thought she <i>was</i> killed, half
a dozen times at least. But she closed the windows
and yanked down the blinds, to shut out the glare.
Then she made one flying leap into the bed and
clutched Nellie as tight as Nellie clutched her, and
vowed to herself that nothing—nothing in the wide
world!—should tear her from the protection of that
bed, until the storm was over.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just as she made that vow, there came from Aunt
Martha’s room a thin, high-pitched wail that made
both little girls catch their breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s Freddie crying for?” asked Nellie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’ll stop in half a jiffy,” said Jacqueline.
“Aunt Martha’ll wake up and take him. Why can’t
she hear him? He’s crying loud enough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was indeed, strangling, gasping, screaming
with fright, and as she listened to him, Jacqueline
grew frightened, too. For if Aunt Martha were in
her room, she would surely wake and go to Freddie,
and if she were <i>not</i> in her room, oh, <i>where</i> could
Aunt Martha be? The night that had been terrible
before with ear-splitting noises and unearthly fires
was doubly terrible now, with the fear of unknown,
ghastly things. Jacqueline’s breath came in uneven
gasps, while she listened agonizedly to hear Aunt
Martha moving about, and heard only Freddie’s
cries.</p>

<p class='c009'>But she couldn’t let him cry like that, she realized.
She would have to go and get him—leave her snug
bed—cross her room—the hall—Aunt Martha’s
room—in that dreadful light and darkness, with the
thunder roaring round her, and the fear of unspoken
things turning her blood to ice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t—I can’t!” Jacqueline’s spirit fairly chittered
within her. But Freddie kept on crying—and
he was just a baby. She couldn’t let him suffer there
alone in the storm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be a sport!” she told herself, through chattering
teeth, and: “Nellie, you shut up!” she said
aloud, in a harsh, snappy voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Out of the bed she got, and she set her teeth
tight, and she made herself run straight into the next
room. By a flash of lightning she could see poor
Freddie, with his face dark and convulsed, as he sat
screaming in his crib, and she could see Aunt
Martha’s bed, with the coverings turned back, and
Aunt Martha—gone. She didn’t dare stop to ask
questions. She just caught up Freddie, who clawed
her neck as he clung like a terrified kitten, and she
ran staggering with him back into her own room.
She plumped him into the bed beside Nellie, and
scuttled in beneath the coverings. She had thought
confusedly that once she was safe back in bed, she
would have a good old cry to relieve her feelings.
But she couldn’t cry. She had to quiet the two
children.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush up now!” she heard herself saying stoutly.
“You’re all safe—you’re here with Jackie—<i>I’ll</i> take
care of you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The thunder volleyed. The lightning flamed.
The storm had lasted an eternity. It would last,
she felt, forever. Then, without warning, there
was Aunt Martha coming in at the door, a dark,
indistinct figure, but with Aunt Martha’s footsteps
that made Jacqueline, at the first sound, cry out with
relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve got Freddie?” Aunt Martha spoke in a
strained, tired voice, not like hers at all. “I knew
I could trust you, Jackie. Look out for him till
morning. I’ve got to stay downstairs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s happened?” whispered Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I went down to close the windows,” Aunt
Martha went on, in that queer, deadened voice.
“I’d left them open because of the heat. Grandma
had got up to see to them. Somehow she must have
lost her bearings, and slipped and fallen. The
phone won’t work. Maybe the wires are down.
Ralph’s going to get out the car and fetch the doctor
right away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Aunt Martha!” Jacqueline cried aloud.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Grandma isn’t——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid,” said Aunt Martha brokenly, “I’m
afraid she’s hurt herself pretty bad.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVI' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <br />THE SERPENT OF REMORSE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The day that followed on the party and the
storm was unlike any day that Jacqueline had
known in her short life, and the week that followed
was unlike any week that she had ever expected to
live.</p>

<p class='c009'>Grandma Conway was very, very ill. She had
not been struck by lightning, as the younger children
believed, nor had she slipped and fallen, as Aunt
Martha had thought at first. She had had a stroke
of apoplexy, so the old doctor said, when he came
plowing through the mud to the farm, on that
ghastly night. She would get well, he hoped, but
she would never be so active again. And she might
be ill for a long time.</p>

<p class='c009'>Grandma’s bed was set up in the parlor, across
the hall from the dining room. It was a big room,
almost square, with windows to the north and the
east. In one corner was a little old square piano,
with yellow keys, on which Freddie’s and Annie’s
mother used to play, when she was a girl. There
were horsehair armchairs, with white crocheted
tidies on their backs, and a horsehair sofa, and a
marble-topped table. All this furniture was pushed
aside, to make place for Grandma’s bed and the old
couch from the dining room on which Aunt Martha
slept so that she could be near her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Upstairs, in Aunt Martha’s room over the dining
room, Annie’s crib now stood beside Freddie’s.
Jacqueline and Nellie slept in Aunt Martha’s bed,
and it was their job to care for the younger children.
Above all they had to see that the children did not
cry in the night and disturb Grandma’s fitful sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline saw these arrangements made, with
honest bewilderment. She thought somewhat of her
own discomfort, packed in a room with two babies,
who woke at the first cock-crow, but to do her
justice, she thought also of Aunt Martha, who
worked hard all day long and was now planning to
watch all night. She remembered, when Auntie
Blair was ill with the flu at Buena Vista, how two
stern young women, in crisp white clothes, had instantly
appeared, and like the lesser and the greater
lights in Genesis, had ruled the day and the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But Aunt Martha,” suggested Jacqueline,
“aren’t you going to hire a nurse?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha’s lips twisted into a smile that
wasn’t the least bit mirthful.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I expect I am, Jackie,” she answered, “’bout
the time I swap the Lizzie for a seven-seated high
class touring car, and shed my old sweater for a
sealskin coat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time Jacqueline had learned enough about
Aunt Martha’s funny way of talking, to understand
that Aunt Martha meant she was too poor to hire
a nurse. Jacqueline felt as if she had been slapped
in the face by the hard hand of a creature called
Poverty, that up to now she had looked upon as
little more than an amusing playfellow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But Aunt Martha,” she urged, “it’s an awful
stunt, nursing sick people. You’ve got the outdoor
work to see to—and the cooking—and the children.
You just can’t do it, Aunt Martha.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again Aunt Martha gave her little twisted smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No such word in the dictionary, Jackie. Besides,
as old Abe Lincoln said, this is a case of
‘Root, hog, or die!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then her twisty smile grew kind, and her anxious
eyes softened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lucky I’ve got you, Jackie,” she said. “I just
felt when I saw you at Baring Station you were
going to be a help and a comfort some day, but I
didn’t dream ’twould be so soon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It wasn’t just empty praise, either. Jacqueline
knew she was a great help—much more help, she
told herself proudly, than little Caroline, afraid of
boys and cows, could ever have been. With Nellie’s
assistance, Jacqueline washed and dressed the
babies, and made the beds, and swept and tidied up
the rooms. She saw to it that Nellie kept the little
ones quite out of earshot through the long day. She
cooked—no pretty-pretend cooking at all, but great
pans of her famous Johnny-cake, and stacks of toast,
and quarts of apple-sauce, platters of scrambled
eggs, and mounds of mashed potato, crocks full of
sugar cookies, and when Aunt Martha found her
the place in the recipe book, big sheets of soft
gingerbread. She couldn’t make pie crust or white
bread, but she stirred up Graham bread, after Aunt
Martha had shown her how, and she had good luck
with it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re a born cook, Jackie,” Aunt Martha told
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Neil and Dickie were called upon to wash the
dishes. That was their share of the extra work,
caused by Grandma’s illness, so Aunt Martha said.
Ralph for his part had to take on many outdoor jobs
and responsibilities which had been Aunt Martha’s,
and Aunt Martha meantime was doing night and
day the work of two nurses, and half of her own
outdoor work and of Grandma’s indoor work
besides.</p>

<p class='c009'>Life at the farm in those days was strenuous, you
may well believe. Jacqueline hadn’t dreamed that
any one could take in a day as many steps as she
now took in Caroline’s old sneakers, nor could be
so tired at night. But she went about her tasks uncomplaining,
with a subdued manner which all the
young folk shared. For Grandma, dear little spry
Grandma, who had worked so hard, as Jacqueline
realized, now that Grandma’s chores in part were
hers, might never step-step it round the kitchen
again. The doctor came twice a day, and Aunt
Martha’s face had not even a twisted smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>At first Jacqueline hadn’t time to think. She just
did the things that had to be done. But as the days
passed, and she grew tired and saw Aunt Martha
growing tired, too, she asked herself: what’s the
use? Money to hire nurses would relieve them
both, and she had money—quite a lot of money.
At least she had heard people at the school say she
was an heiress, and she knew she had always been
given plenty of money when she asked for it. She
could ask for it now. She would go to the Gildersleeves.</p>

<p class='c009'>No, she couldn’t go to the Gildersleeves, for there
was her promise to Caroline. She wished she had
never given it. She had known when she gave it,
like a silly, that she was going to regret it. But
just the same, a promise was a promise. It wouldn’t
be fair now, when things were so hard at the farm,
to ask Caroline to give up the piano, and the cool
rooms, and the pretty frocks that she so loved, and
never would have again, poor kid! and come and
take her rightful place with the Conways.</p>

<p class='c009'>Well, she wouldn’t go to the Gildersleeves, but
she’d write home for money—a lot of money! She
couldn’t write to Uncle Jimmie and Aunt Edie, for
they were honeymooning all over the surface of
Alaska, nor to Auntie Blair, for she was somewhere
on the shores of the Great Lakes. But she could
write to Auntie Blair’s father, Judge Blair, who with
Aunt Edie shared her guardianship. Only he would
address his reply—and the money!—to Jacqueline
Gildersleeve, and Caroline would get them, because
in Longmeadow Caroline was Jacqueline. That
wouldn’t do at all. He must address his letter to
Caroline Tait and then Jacqueline would receive it.
But in order to get him to do such an extraordinary
thing, she would have to explain to him how she
happened to have become Caroline. Oh, shivering
chimpanzees, and also woolly rhinoceroses! For
Jacqueline was afraid of Judge Blair, if she was
afraid of anybody, and besides, like a blundering
grown-up, he would probably write straight off to
the Gildersleeves and tell them everything that she
had told him.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last she decided that whatever she did, she
would see Caroline first. Perhaps they could arrange
something between them. Why couldn’t
Judge Blair send the money to Jacqueline (that is,
to Caroline), and Caroline take it, and give it to
the real Jacqueline? Why, of course, that was the
way out of her difficulties, and she need only see
Caroline right straight off, and tell her about it.</p>

<p class='c009'>It took Jacqueline some time to think this all
out. She hadn’t had to do a great deal of thinking
for herself in her life, and this problem was what
her new Uncle Jimmie would have called “intrikut.”
Besides she had to give a great many of her thoughts
just now to the children, and the cooking, and Aunt
Martha, who kept forgetting to eat, and poor
Grandma, who was always there in the back of her
mind, and the depth of her heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the day came, after a week of dragging days
that seemed a year, when the doctor looked quite
cheerful after his morning visit, and said he wouldn’t
need to come again until to-morrow. Aunt Martha
turned from seeing him out at the door, with a smile
that wasn’t a bit twisted, and when Jacqueline saw
that smile, her head began to swim for joy, and her
eyes went misty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s going to get well! Grandma’s going to
get well!” Jacqueline chanted under her breath,
while she jumped up and down softly in her
sneakers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Glad you’ve spunk enough left to hop,” said
Aunt Martha.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hop?” beamed Jacqueline. “I could run a mile.
Oh, Aunt Martha, can’t I go to the village this
afternoon? I won’t be long. I’ll run most of the
way——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she stopped. For she saw, by Aunt
Martha’s face, that she was no more going to Longmeadow
that afternoon than she was going to Timbuctoo.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d like to let you go right well, Jackie,” said
Aunt Martha, “but I don’t see how I can spare you.
I’ve got to get over to East Baring and see about
selling the wood lot. It’s a piece of business Ralph
can’t tend to. I was counting on leaving you to sit
with Grandma.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline shivered a little. Honestly she was
afraid of the strange, white, withered woman who
lay helpless in Grandma’s bed. And for all their
sakes she wanted to see Caroline and arrange about
getting that money just as quickly as possible. But
she had no choice in the matter. She couldn’t explain
to Aunt Martha why she wanted to go to
Longmeadow and she couldn’t expect Aunt Martha
to alter business plans just on account of what
must seem to her a child’s desire to take a holiday.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Aunt Martha drove away that afternoon in
the Ford, and took Freddie with her, to relieve
Jacqueline of one care, and Jacqueline settled herself
by the north window in the parlor, ready to be
of service, if Grandma so much as whispered.
Jacqueline might have read story papers while she
sat there, but she hated even the thought of those
story papers. If she hadn’t sat reading, all that
hot day before the day of the party, and left the
work to Grandma, perhaps Grandma wouldn’t have
been taken ill. She didn’t dare ask Aunt Martha
if this were so. She kept the thought to herself,
and was tortured with it. She never wanted to see
that pile of story papers again, as long as she lived.
In their place she got out the big, overflowing
mending basket (Grandma’s basket!) and darned
stockings patiently through the long afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had hoped that Aunt Martha would be home
at four o’clock to give Grandma her cup of broth.
But there was never a sign of Aunt Martha, when
four o’clock struck. “Root, hog, or die!” as old Abe
Lincoln said of a disagreeable job. Jacqueline went
into the kitchen, and warmed the broth, and put it
into a thick white cup, and carried it to Grandma.</p>

<p class='c009'>The feeble old white head shifted itself on the
pillow, as Jacqueline slipped an arm beneath it, as
she had seen Aunt Martha do, and gently raised it.
The pale old lips approached the thick edge of the
coarse cup.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No—no,” Grandma muttered, and turned away
her head. “Not that. Cup.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Drink it, Grandma dear,” begged Jacqueline.
“I warmed it up real nice. Do, please drink it and
get well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My cup,” whispered Grandma. “No—no.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She shut her eyes and her lips, with the obstinacy
of the very feeble, and turned her head away.
Jacqueline looked down at her helplessly. From
beneath the pale eyelids she saw two tears course
slowly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Grandma! Don’t!” begged Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cup,” murmured Grandma. “Want—green
cup.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Jacqueline understood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <br />AGAINST A CLOSED DOOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Jacqueline laid Grandma down, very gently,
and put away the rejected broth, which was too
precious to be thrown out, and rinsed the thick cup.
As she stood drying it, she found that she was softly
crying.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, it was too dreadful! Poor little old
Grandma, who had never been able to relish tea
drunk from thick crockery, was begging now in her
illness for the delicate green cup that had been all
that was left of her precious wedding china—and it
was Jacqueline, in her moment of bad temper, who
had broken it! Once more Jacqueline felt as she
had felt long ago, when she had struck the little
lap dog. Quite frankly she wept into the dish
towel that she was using.</p>

<p class='c009'>But now she <i>must</i> see Caroline right away.
Whatever else they went without, there at the farm,
Grandma must have the thin china for which she
pined. Wildly Jacqueline thought of running away
to Longmeadow that very night. But sober second
thought showed her the folly of such a plan. Even
if Aunt Martha were willing to let her go, she
hadn’t the courage, after her former experience, to
trudge through the onion fields alone, in the dark.</p>

<p class='c009'>A very subdued Jacqueline, she greeted Aunt
Martha on her return.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Grandma’s been all right,” she said. “Only I
couldn’t get her to take her broth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha clicked her tongue against her
teeth. Black smudges of weariness showed beneath
her unsmiling eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s that way, half the time,” she told Jacqueline.
“Sick folks get notions. I’ll see if I can coax
her to take it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But when Aunt Martha came out of the parlor,
Jacqueline knew, by the worried look she wore, that
she hadn’t been successful.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline ran to her—she couldn’t help it!—and
threw her arms about her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Aunt Martha!” she whimpered. “It’s all
my fault. She wants her green-dragon cup—and I
broke it. I’ve just <i>got</i> to go to the village to-morrow
and get her another.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha held Jacqueline close.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, there,” she said, and patted her. “No
use crying over spilt milk, child. There isn’t another
of those old green-dragon cups to be had for
love nor money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I can get her a thin cup, I know I can,”
begged Jacqueline. “<i>Please</i> let me go try!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You haven’t the money, Jackie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The words were on Jacqueline’s tongue: “I
know how to get it!” She bit them back just in
time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Grandma’ll get over the notion,” Aunt Martha
comforted. “Just put the whole thing out of your
mind, now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Jacqueline didn’t. She dreamed all night of
green dragons off the cup that were chasing her, and
the green dragons turned into green banknotes, and
she wheeled a barrowful of them home to Aunt
Martha and Grandma.</p>

<p class='c009'>She woke in the morning, quite determined.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a pretty cool day,” she told Aunt Martha.
“I could walk to Longmeadow easy as not. Honest,
it wouldn’t tire me a bit, and I’ll be back in time to
get supper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha smiled, as if in spite of herself.
“If you aren’t the most persistent young one!”
she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t I?” begged Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha hesitated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve worked real faithful,” she said at last.
“I guess if it’s any treat to go to Longmeadow, you
ought to have it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh goody, Aunt Martha!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t crack my ribs, Jackie! You hug like a
young bear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll start right after dinner——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, you won’t, child. Ralph’s got to drive up
to the north end of town. You can ride up
with him ’bout two o’clock. He’ll pick you up at the
Post Office long ’bout five. The library’s open to-day.
You can sit in there when you get tired
looking for cups in Miss Crevey’s, and Cyrus Hatton’s,
and the Post Office. I suppose that’s what you’re
calculating to do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Y-yes,” Jacqueline admitted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Privately she assured herself that it was no lie
that she told. She certainly would go and hunt for
cups in the three Longmeadow shops, but she would
go only <i>after</i> she had seen Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>At half past one by the kitchen clock, Jacqueline
cast a proud glance at the bowl of stewed goose-berries,
cooling on the table by the window, at the
well-brushed floor, and the well-scrubbed sink, all
the work of her hands. Then she skipped happily
up the narrow stair, but softly, not to disturb Grandma,
and in her old room, over the parlor, made
ready for her trip to Longmeadow. She felt that
bare ankles and Peggy Janes did not quite fit with
the importance of her mission. She put on a pair of
Caroline’s cotton socks, and the identical pink and
white checked gingham in which she first had seen
Caroline on the train.</p>

<p class='c009'>As a last touch of elegance, she hunted for a hair-ribbon,
and during the search in a top drawer, not
so tidy as it might be, she came upon the box of
Japanese lacquer, which she had half forgotten.
Caroline’s treasures were in that box—the trinkets,
the letters, the photograph—but of far more interest
to Jacqueline was the old pink hair-ribbon
bound round the box. She slipped it off, smoothed
it across her knee, and tied her hair with a rather
lop-sided bow. She didn’t altogether admire the
effect, when she looked at herself in the mirror, but
it was the best she could do, and as Grandma liked
to say: “Angels could do no more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The drive into Longmeadow was not the jolliest
pleasure trip imaginable. The road was dusty, and
the little old car wheezed till you pitied it almost as if
it were human. Besides, Ralph let it be clearly
understood that he didn’t see the need for a girl,
who did nothing but putter round the house, to take
an afternoon off, and leave his mother to do everything.
If Dickie, or Neil, now, had wanted a holiday,
that would be different. Ralph, you see, was
quite on the way to being a man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You make me tired,” Jacqueline told him loftily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that so?” retorted Ralph. “Then it’s more
than the work you do will ever make you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After that, no more words passed between them.
With chill dignity, for all the scantness of her faded
skirts, Jacqueline descended from the car at the foot
of Longmeadow Street.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll be at the Post Office at five o’clock,” she
said, in the tone in which haughty society ladies are
supposed to say: “Home, James!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’d better be, for I shan’t wait for you,”
Ralph called back, before he rattled away in a cloud
of dust.</p>

<p class='c009'>Well, maybe he’d behave a little more respectfully
by and bye, Jacqueline told herself darkly,
as she trudged up the street. When he saw her
hiring two nurses—and having huge baskets of
grapes sent up from Boston for Grandma—and a
lovely silk dressing-gown—and a wheelchair—and
a down coverlet—and a darling invalid’s table, with
egg-shell china!</p>

<p class='c009'>Once more Jacqueline lost herself in gorgeous
dreams of what she was going to do—dreams that
blew up like a burst balloon, as she found herself
actually within sight of the Gildersleeve place. She
halted short. The house looked so big, above its
surrounding elms, and she felt so little, all at once,
in Caroline’s skimpy gingham. Perhaps she had
better not go in at the front gate. Perhaps she had
better slip in through the gap in the hedge, as
she had done that earlier time. Perhaps by great
good luck she might find Caroline in the summer
house.</p>

<p class='c009'>But she found the summer house quite orderly
and empty, and the garden was very still. Perhaps
Aunt Eunice was taking a nap. She could see
through the branches of the trees that the shutters
were closed at the windows—all the windows at that
side of the house. Or perhaps, better still, Aunt
Eunice and Cousin Penelope had gone out to pay
calls. If only they had gone out, and left Caroline
at home!</p>

<p class='c009'>Buoyed up with this hope, Jacqueline scurried
along the neat path through the gay-colored, sweet-scented
garden, threaded the shrubbery, crossed the
lawn, and ran lightly up the steps of the cool, wide
porch. The white paneled door, with its ancient
fan-light, was firmly closed. She grasped the big
shining brass knocker, and without waiting for her
courage to ooze, rapped loudly.</p>

<p class='c009'>She waited. She grew very conscious of her
skimpy dress and her rumpled hair-ribbon. She wondered
what she should say, if the maid, when she
came, refused to call “Miss Jacqueline,” and went
and summoned Cousin Penelope.</p>

<p class='c009'>She knocked again timidly.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one came. The lawn and the garden were
very still. She heard a pear fall ripely from a tree.
A car drove by on the road. Moments passed. She
felt her cheeks begin to burn. She was as angry as if
she had known that people stood behind the door,
deliberately letting her knock and knock, unanswered,
because her dress was faded and scant.
She grabbed that knocker, and she beat such a tattoo
on the old door as surely it had seldom known in its
venerable life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rat-tat-tat banged the knocker, with horrid
brazen clangor, until Jacqueline had to stop for
breath. She was now more white than red. Of
course they must be there—the maids, at least. Off
their job, because Aunt Eunice had gone out. She’d
show ’em.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rat-tat-tat went the knocker, and then Jacqueline’s
feet, in the scuffed sneakers, were kicking at
the door, and Jacqueline’s hands were thumping
futilely upon the smooth white panels.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me in!” cried Jacqueline, afraid, she hardly
knew of what. “Let me in—in—IN!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She stopped suddenly. She had heard footsteps
on the walk below the porch. She turned, and there
stood a stout, solemn little girl, with tow-colored
hair, in a neat white frock and sandals.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That won’t do a bit of good,” said the little girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Smarty!” said Jacqueline. “How do you
know?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Smarty yourself,” answered the little girl. “I
know ’cause I live next door. I’m Eleanor Trowbridge,
and Jacqueline told me to come here and
play in her summer house while they’re gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gone?” Jacqueline echoed foolishly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure,” said Eleanor. “Don’t you suppose they’d
come out and tell you to stop banging that knocker,
if they were here? They all went off yesterday, and
Jacqueline took Mildred with her. They’ve gone
way off to the seashore, and they won’t be back till
it’s time for school again.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /> <br />THE UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If Jacqueline had been given to quoting poetry,
she might have said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘I feel chilly, and grown old!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Not being given that way, she confessed merely to
what Grandma called “a gone feeling.” She sat
down suddenly on the steps of the porch, quite as
if she had been hit a sudden hard clip in the stomach.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What makes you look so funny?” Eleanor
Trowbridge asked sociably. “Are you coming down
with something? I went and nearly had rash but I
didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where have they gone?” Jacqueline interrupted
Eleanor’s flow of confidences.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the beach, I told you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For goodness’ sake! <i>What</i> beach? I suppose
there’s more than <i>one</i> in your horrid old New England.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This insult to the land of her fathers provoked
Eleanor, not without reason. She tossed her head
and answered snappishly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother says I shouldn’t tell all I know to every
stranger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned and started to walk away, but not very
eagerly. Jacqueline mastered the desire to shake
her, got up, and went after her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now don’t get peeved,” she told Eleanor. “I’ve
got a most special reason why I want to see—er—Jacqueline.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what of it?” Eleanor muttered ungraciously,
but without walking on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a great secret,” Jacqueline admitted.
“Maybe some day I’ll tell you.” She smiled—and
you may remember that she had a quite bewitching
smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you tell me? Honest and truly?” Eleanor
asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cross my heart and hope to die if I don’t,”
Jacqueline rattled off glibly. “There’s a mystery—and
I’ll let you in on it some time—if you’ll only
tell me where she’s gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear!” whined Eleanor. “But I don’t
know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t know?” repeated Jacqueline blankly, while
once more the green world seemed to rock beneath
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She didn’t tell me,” Eleanor explained in an injured
tone. “She cooey’d over the hedge, and said
they were going off, so we couldn’t play tea party in
the afternoon, and they went in the limousine with
the trunks in the carrier, and Sallie and Hannah—that’s
the cook—went on a vacation, and she said
the beach, but she didn’t say what beach, and
Mildred was all dressed up in a sailor suit with such a
ducky hat, and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When did they go?” Jacqueline stemmed the torrent of words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, just yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Yesterday! Only yesterday! By such a narrow
margin she had missed Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dumb-paste it!” cried Jacqueline, beside herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a bad word,” said Eleanor austerely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Tisn’t either,” Jacqueline retorted. “Don’t
you ever paste things?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not that way,” insisted Eleanor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I don’t care,” said Jacqueline morosely.
“I suppose she isn’t going to write you?” she caught
at the last rag of fluttering hope.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eleanor was eager with explanations:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I asked her to, but she looked scared, and said
she never wrote letters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, docile Caroline! Only too well had she remembered
and carried out the instructions of her
leader. The reward of her docility was that
Jacqueline merely yearned to shake her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” Jacqueline controlled herself with effort.
“It looks as if I couldn’t get at her till she comes
back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It looks that way,” agreed Eleanor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline gazed hopelessly at the big house, her
haven of refuge, shuttered, bolted, barred against
her, by people who were gone, no one could tell her
where.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re sure,” she faltered, “that even the maids
have gone? Perhaps they could tell me——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure they’re gone,” said Eleanor cheerfully.
“They asked our Maggie to feed the gray cat that
comes round their garage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” she said, like a game little echo of her
Uncle Jimmie. “I guess I’d better be on my way.”
Eleanor tagged at her side through the fragrant
garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Couldn’t you stay and play with me?” she suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not to-day, kid,” Jacqueline told her loftily. She
felt herself older than Eleanor—immeasurably
older. Wasn’t she suddenly called upon to face a
problem beyond Eleanor’s grasping—a problem such
as she had never expected to be called upon to face?</p>

<p class='c009'>Out in Longmeadow Street, which was all a
pleasant checker-board of light and shadow, Jacqueline
lagged slowly toward the Post Office. What
should she do, she asked herself, over and over
again? She <i>must</i> get some money. But she couldn’t
reach Caroline, not for weeks and weeks. She
would have to write directly to Judge Blair, and
ask him to address the answer to her as Caroline
Tait, and she would have to tell him why. Not
that! For he would be sure to write the whole story
to Aunt Eunice (he, no doubt, in the inscrutable
wisdom of grown-ups, would know where to find
her) and then——</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline might be mad enough at Caroline for
letting herself be whisked away, no one knew where,
without a word to her, but still she wasn’t going to
let her in for the sort of scolding she was sure that
pinch-faced Cousin Penelope was bound to give her,
when she found her to be an impostor. No, she’d
got to grin and bear it. No money—no chance to
get money—and all the work to do—and Aunt
Martha tired out—and Grandma crying in her
feebleness for the thin china that no one could afford
to buy her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, prancing camelopards, and bounding orang-outangs!
Also chisel-toothed baboons! There were
not beasts enough in the menagerie, nor words
enough in the unabridged dictionary to express the
feelings that surged in Jacqueline’s bosom beneath
the faded pink and white checked gingham! She
felt the tears of hot anger and disappointment and
pity, too, for little Grandma, well up into her eyes.
To hide them from the curious gaze of two young
girls, who came sauntering toward her along the
graveled sidewalk, she stopped, and stared hard
into a convenient shop window, which happened to
be Miss Crevey’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were all sorts of things displayed in the
window—cards of white ruching, edged with black,
novels by Mary Jane Holmes, glass jars of wilted
candy sticks, china boxes with the words “Souvenir
of Longmeadow” painted in gilt upon them, sheets
of dusty paper dolls in staring colors. Jacqueline’s
gaze passed over the queer assortment of articles,
and rested on the little shelf against the wall, at one
side of the window. On the shelf was a glove box
of birch bark and cones and a bright-colored copy of
“The Angelus,” and between them——</p>

<p class='c009'>She rubbed her eyes. She looked again. Yes,
between them stood what Aunt Martha had vowed
no longer could be had for love nor money—a cup
of thin china—an ancient cup—with a pattern of
green dragons.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIX' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXIX<br /> <br />SO MUCH FOR SO MUCH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Inside Miss Crevey’s stuffy little shop a woman
customer kept insisting that she must have lilac
ribbon two inches wide, although Miss Crevey told
her that blue ribbon three inches wide, which Miss
Crevey happened to have in stock, would be just as
good, if not better. Jacqueline teetered impatiently
from one foot to the other, while she waited for the
end of the argument. The woman left at last in
dudgeon, without buying so much as a paper of pins.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, there’s no suitin’ some folks,” Miss
Crevey muttered waspishly, and turned to Jacqueline.
“Come now, what d’ye want, little girl?
Speak up! I won’t have no young ones hangin’
round in here, handlin’ things and askin’ questions.
Ain’t you got a tongue?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Most certainly Jacqueline had, and she used it,
the moment Miss Crevey stopped for breath and
gave her half a chance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you please,” she said, “I want to know the
price of the cup and saucer on the shelf in the window.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Crevey fixed her eyes on a dinky little
“Souvenir of Longmeadow” that might have graced
a doll’s tea table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fifty cents,” she said, “but you’d better buy the
match box and get more for your money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t mean that one,” protested Jacqueline.
“I meant the one with green dragons, there on the
shelf.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That old cup?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, please. How much is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Crevey looked at her with hostile eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s more ’n you can pay,” she said flatly.
“It’s worth five dollars, Mrs. Enos Trowbridge told
me—five dollars, if it’s worth a cent. Run along
now! I can’t waste my time tellin’ you the price
of everything in the store.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t asked the price of <i>everything</i>,” Jacqueline
retorted. “I only asked about the green-dragon
cup. Let me look at it, will you please?”</p>

<p class='c009'>So loftily did she speak, and so sure did she seem
of herself, that Miss Crevey took the cup and saucer
from the shelf although she grumbled a little as she
did so.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There they be!” she said, as she set them on the
counter. “Don’t you go droppin’ them now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Luckily at that moment a young girl from upstreet
stepped in, to buy a piece of tape, and some
white hooks and eyes (she had to be contented with
black) and some orange twist, though she finally
took yellow. While Miss Crevey was making these
small sales, Jacqueline had time to examine the
dragon cup and saucer at leisure. Yes, they were of
identically the same pattern as Grandma’s cups and
saucers that were broken. Jacqueline couldn’t be
mistaken. She had washed and dried them too
often. Aunt Martha had told her that such china
couldn’t be had now for love nor money, but here
it was, the very cup she wanted—Grandma’s cup!</p>

<p class='c009'>The screen door slammed as the young girl went
out, not too well pleased, it would seem, with her
makeshift purchases.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well!” said Miss Crevey briskly. “If you’re
through playin’ with that cup and saucer, I’ll just
set ’em up out o’ harm’s way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I want to buy them,” faltered Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Got five dollars handy?” challenged Miss
Crevey.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline swallowed and stared hard at the
precious cup, so that she need not meet Miss
Crevey’s gimlet eyes. Oh, if only she had some of
the money that she had spent so carelessly at home
and at school! Why, she had often given a five-dollar
bill for a box of candy, and got back with it
only a few bits of silver—chicken-feed, she had
liked to call them grandly. If only she had one of
those bills now! If only she could go home proudly,
with Grandma’s cup!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Make up your mind!” urged the implacable Miss
Crevey. “Take it or leave it—I can’t wait all day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline felt herself backed against the wall.
She must do something, and do it quickly, or the
precious cup and saucer would go back upon the
shelf, and then as likely as not they would be
snapped up next minute by some other customer
and lost to Grandma forever. She could almost
see the entire town of Longmeadow, charging into
the shop to buy that cup, and nothing but that cup.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold on!” she said, and she was thinking fast.
“Couldn’t you—trust me? I’ll have the money in
September, sure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course she would! Even if Caroline and the
Gildersleeves didn’t get back in time for school, as
Eleanor Trowbridge prophesied, Aunt Edie and
Uncle Jimmie were due in September.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Crevey looked at her coldly. Oh, how conscious
Jacqueline grew of the scantiness and shabbiness
of her faded gingham! She blushed, and was
angry at herself for blushing, and so blushed all
the harder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where d’ye expect to get the money?” Miss
Crevey shot the words from her thin lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m eleven in September,” Jacqueline said
truthfully. “And I have a pretend-aunt that always
gives me money on my birthday, and she will this
time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, when you get the money,” Miss Crevey
spoke like one conferring a great favor, “I’ll let you
have the cup and saucer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you keep them for me till I get the money?”
asked Jacqueline desperately.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why of course I will,” cried Miss Crevey heartily,
“unless somebody comes along that’ll pay me
spot cash for them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The tears of disappointment rose to Jacqueline’s
eyes. She blinked them rapidly away. She must
not let this hateful woman see her cry. But she was
so sorry for Grandma—and so sorry for herself!
She remembered how hopefully she had dressed for
the little trip to Longmeadow, only an hour ago—how
she had made herself so extra neat, with a hair ribbon,
too—the look of the upper drawer, as she
tossed its contents over—handkerchiefs, stockings,
underwear—a Japanese lacquer box.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline caught her breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here!” she spoke, as one inspired. “If
I brought you something worth <i>more</i> than five dollars
and let you keep it till September when I shall
have some money—then would you let me have
the cup and saucer and take them home—right
now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Crevey pursed her lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What d’ye mean by <i>something</i>?” she asked stabbingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline’s heart was beating fast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a pin,” she said, “and there’s a pearl in
it—or there’s gold beads—a chain of them. I know
gold beads are worth a lot more than five dollars.
Oh, couldn’t you take them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do I know till I see them?” snapped Miss
Crevey. “You bring ’em in some day—then we’ll
talk business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to go and get them right straight off,”
she said, “and don’t you sell that cup and saucer till
I come back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Strange though it may seem to you, it didn’t enter
Jacqueline’s head that she was doing a dreadful
thing in taking Caroline’s precious keepsakes to use
as a pledge. In a half-formed way she felt that
Caroline, by going off to the seashore, had brought
this trouble upon her, and so was bound to help her
out, in any way she could. She felt, too, that the
fact that Grandma was really a relation of Caroline’s,
not of hers, made the whole arrangement perfectly
fair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still, Jacqueline might have seen her conduct in
a different light, if she had taken time to sleep upon
it. But she took no time. For luck played into her
hand in a breathlessly amazing fashion. When she
burst out of Miss Crevey’s shop, with a crazy idea
of running clear to the farm and back, before Ralph
got to the Post Office at five o’clock, whom should
she see, heading down the street toward his home in
the Meadows, but friendly Mr. Griswold!</p>

<p class='c009'>Shrieking like a lost soul, Jacqueline sprinted
after him, and fortunately she made him hear. A
moment later she was seated at his side in his ramshackle,
blessed old car. A short half-hour later,
with warnings to Nellie never to tell, she was creeping
up the stairs to their old room, so paddy-pawed
that Aunt Martha, busy changing Grandma’s sheets,
behind the closed doors of the parlor, never heard a
sound.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without pausing one moment to think, she opened
the lacquer box and took out the string of gold
beads. She knotted them safely in the corner of a
clean pocket handkerchief, and quietly as she had
entered, slipped out of the house again.</p>

<p class='c009'>She ran part of the long, dusty road back to
the village. Suppose she should come too late—suppose
she should find the cup already sold—suppose
oh! suppose Miss Crevey refused to keep to
the bargain! But none of these dreadful things
came to pass. When she panted into the close little
shop, she found the dragon cup and saucer still in
the window, and she found Miss Crevey mindful of
the agreement.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shrewdly Miss Crevey examined the beads.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be they yours?” she asked suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heirlooms,” stammered Jacqueline, and then
dodged the subject. “I know they’re worth more
than five dollars.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hm!” sniffed Miss Crevey. She sounded noncommittal
enough, but she put the beads into the
drawer of an old secretary behind the counter, and
turned the key upon them. Then she wrapped the
cup and saucer carefully in old newspapers, and even,
for greater safety, packed them in a large old button
box.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t ye break ’em now!” she cautioned.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline didn’t. She had broken enough dragon
china, she felt, to last her for a lifetime. She
climbed into the car beside Ralph, at five o’clock,
as circumspectly as if it were a baby that she held
in her arms. She clambered out again at the kitchen
door of the farm, with equal care.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aunt Martha!” she cried gaspingly. “Aunt
Martha! See what I’ve got. I told you I would.
For Grandma!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With hands that shook with eagerness, Jacqueline
unwrapped the cup and saucer, and for once she saw
Aunt Martha stand (in Grandma’s phrase!) “flabbergasted.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For the land sake, Jackie!” Aunt Martha finally
got her breath. “Wherever in the world did you
dig up that old china?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I found it—in Miss Crevey’s shop.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jackie! You never got it for nothing!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My pretend-aunt will send me some money on
my birthday.” Jacqueline spoke fast. “I’ll pay
Miss Crevey then. It’s all right, Aunt Martha.
Honest, it is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha handled the cup and saucer almost
reverently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seems like a miracle,” she said, in a hushed voice.
“I don’t mind telling you now, Jackie, we were
worried to death because Grandma wouldn’t eat
enough to keep up her strength, but now—why,
when she sees her own old cup——”</p>

<p class='c009'>She broke off, as if she couldn’t make the words
come, and patted Jacqueline’s shoulder. From Aunt
Martha that meant as much as a hug and a kiss
from Aunt Edie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve done a good day’s work, Jackie,” Aunt
Martha found words again, as she turned away,
and in the glow and triumph of the moment Jacqueline
almost forgot that the gold beads that were
Caroline’s lay under lock and key in Miss Crevey’s
dusty secretary.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXX' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXX<br /> <br />SLEEPY-HEAD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Really Caroline deserved none of the hard
things that Jacqueline thought of her. She
of course hadn’t had the least suspicion that her sudden
departure to unknown places would be a
tragedy for Jacqueline. Just the same she would
have sent Jacqueline some word about this change
in the summer’s plans, if only she had had the
chance. But when you remember that Cousin Penelope
had made up her mind to protect her darling
from that pushing horrid little girl from the
Meadows, (and when you remember Cousin Penelope!)
you will realize that Caroline had about as
much chance to send a message to Jacqueline as a
nice little round snowball to survive in the middle
of a red-hot furnace.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were going away next morning, Cousin
Penelope had announced one evening at dinner.
They were going to the beach, because Cousin
Marcia Vintner wasn’t using her cottage, and Aunt
Eunice needed change of air (Aunt Eunice had
never looked better in her life!) and Jacqueline, so
Cousin Penelope had decided, was dying to paddle
in the waves and run on the sands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Privately Jacqueline’s little understudy was very
well pleased where she was, but she would have
been less than a human child, if she hadn’t thrilled
at the thought of a journey, especially in that smooth
rolling, softly upholstered limousine, which still
seemed to her a palace on wheels.</p>

<p class='c009'>She spent a busy evening in helping Cousin Penelope
select and pack in a little leather trunk the
things that she would need at the beach. Fully half
of Jacqueline’s pretty wardrobe was to be left at
The Chimnies and some of the most valuable of her
trinkets.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll put these pins and chains in the library safe,”
said Cousin Penelope. “The house will be closed,
you know, while we are away, and though we’ve
never had such a thing as a burglar in Longmeadow,
it’s better to be safe than sorry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline agreed. She was ready to agree to anything.
She went to bed, full of happy thoughts of
the journey before her, and then for the first time
she remembered Jacqueline, and grew uneasy. Was
it fair to stay in Jacqueline’s place, even at Jacqueline’s
bidding, and enjoy this trip to the beach that
Jacqueline had not foreseen? But she couldn’t give
away the secret that was one-half Jacqueline’s and
that Jacqueline had ordered her to keep, until she
had consulted with Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>And how was she to get at Jacqueline? She
couldn’t go herself to the Meadows, even if she had
had the time to do so, and she couldn’t telephone.
She fairly quaked in her cozy bed as she thought of
the stern, accusing face that Cousin Penelope would
turn upon her, should she catch her actually telephoning
to the house in the Meadows that sheltered
the child she had denounced as rude and pushing.
She would rather die than attempt to telephone
Jacqueline from The Chimnies—but there were
other telephones in Longmeadow!</p>

<p class='c009'>What a ninny she had been not to think of that
before! First thing in the morning she would run
over to the Trowbridges’. She could venture it, for
she and Eleanor were now quite intimate friends.
She would telephone Jacqueline, and let her know
that they were going away to the beach. Not that
it would make any difference to Jackie, but she would
feel better herself to have done what she felt was
the fair thing to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wasn’t it strange that when so much depended
on her waking early, Caroline should oversleep?
Actually she waked only when Cousin Penelope, in
her lavender dressing-gown, stood laughing over
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurry, little Sleepy-head!” cried Cousin Penelope.
“I let you rest till the last minute, but breakfast
will be on the table now before you can say
Jack Robinson, and we must start right after breakfast,
or we’ll have to travel in the heat of the day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>You know yourself how it is when you rise late
and dress in a hurry. Stubborn snarls in the brown
locks that just wouldn’t come out—button-holes in
the freshly laundered garments that closed their
mean lips and wouldn’t admit the buttons—a hair-ribbon
that peevishly had lost itself—finally a
weakened clasp on the chain of tiny gold beads that
she meant to wear, which let the whole string go
slipping coldly down within her undergarments.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline had just recovered the beads, when she
heard the soft notes of the Chinese gongs that made
always such a pleasant prelude to meals at The
Chimnies. She dared not trust the shallow pockets
of her mouse-colored smock, so she left the beads
upon the dressing-table. Later she would put them
into her little vanity bag (Jacqueline’s vanity bag!)
when she came back to her room for her hat and her
coat and Mildred, who was all dressed and waiting.
But she couldn’t stop now, not even to open the
vanity bag. One must never be late to meals.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a hurried breakfast, thrilled with the pleasant
sense of a journey to follow! Cousin Penelope
was already hatted, with her veil of palest mauve
pushed back from her eager face. Sallie, as she
waited at table, was all smiles and good cheer. She,
too, was happy at the thought of a long holiday.
Aunt Eunice’s old cheeks were delicately flushed.
Perhaps after all she really needed sea air, as Cousin
Penelope so generously had suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must eat more than a humming-bird,
Jacqueline,” Aunt Eunice urged. “It will be a long
time to luncheon time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll lunch in Boston,” said Cousin Penelope,
in her masterful manner. “I wrote Dr. Stoddard
for an appointment. He’ll put in another hour on
Jacqueline’s teeth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, misery!” thought Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we must get Jacqueline a bathing suit,”
added Cousin Penelope.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And some sand toys,” supplemented Aunt
Eunice. “You and Mildred aren’t too old to make
me some sand pies, are you, dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline smiled, and do you know, though her
smile came less frequently than Jacqueline’s, it was
just as sweet?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, Jacqueline!” Cousin Penelope was calling
next moment from down the hall. Such an
energetic Cousin Penelope as she was that early
morning! “We must select some music to take
along.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” cried Caroline, swooping after her. “Will
there be a piano?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you think we could live without one? I’m
urging Madame Woleski to spend at least a week
with us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A week under the same roof with Madame
Woleski! Carried away with the prospect of such
happiness, Caroline forgot everything but the music
that she sorted—music that she might some time
play for Madame Woleski’s criticism. She actually
forgot that Jacqueline existed, until she heard the
cushioned wheels of the great limousine roll singingly
across the gravel of the drive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” cried Caroline, in dismay. “And I’ve got
to say good-by to Eleanor Trowbridge!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s no time now, dear,” warned Cousin
Penelope.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I must,” cried Caroline desperately. “I
must—show her Mildred—in her sailor suit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She flew up the stairs to her room. She snatched
up the doll and fairly flew down again. She rushed
out of the house and tore across the garden. To
her joy she saw Eleanor Trowbridge there at the
other side of the hedge and the rose tangle, in the
swing that hung from a branch of the big elm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cooey!” cried Caroline.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eleanor came hurrying on her sturdy legs, and
when Eleanor stood before her, a very solid person,
Caroline lost her courage. She couldn’t say right
out plump: “Let me into your house to use your
telephone, quick!” as she had meant to say. She
stammered and hesitated and talked about the
journey. She was leading the subject round to the
telephone. Presently she would get there! Oh,
how her heart was beating, and Eleanor, the solid
and stolid, didn’t give her a bit of help.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can play in our summer house while I’m
gone,” said Caroline, and she meant to add, “if
you’ll let me use your telephone now,” but she never
said the words, for just then Cousin Penelope came
tripping across the garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Last call for the Boston train!” Cousin Penelope
cried gayly. “Hurry, Jacqueline! We’ve got
to stop in the village for gas and oil, and we’re half
an hour behind schedule already.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Caroline, quite helpless, was hurried away to
the car, beneath the envious eyes of Eleanor Trowbridge.
Already the luggage was strapped on the
carrier, and Aunt Eunice was cozily seated in the
car. Beside her were the little vanity bag, the straw
hat, with its flame-colored band, and the little leaf
brown cape coat that Caroline should wear upon
the journey.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sallie fetched down your things,” smiled Aunt
Eunice. “Jump in, my dear, and off we go!”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Caroline jumped in. What else could she do?
And in the joy and excitement of setting out on a delightful
journey, she almost forgot that she had
thought it of prime importance, only last night, to
telephone Jacqueline, and she quite forgot the
string of beads (Jacqueline’s beads!) that she had
left upon the dressing-table.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Sallie who found those beads later, when
she went to “do” the room that was Caroline’s.
Being neat and methodical, Sallie took the beads
and dropped them into the Dresden china trinket
box upon the dressing-table, and then in the excitement
of hurrying off on her own holiday, she too forgot
them—but not forever!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXXI' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXI<br /> <br />A LETTER FROM ALASKA</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Cousin Marcia Vintner, who was Aunt
Eunice’s cousin, and stood to Jacqueline in
some obscure relationship that Caroline never was
able to work out, had thoughtfully gone away for
the summer to the Bosphorus. The cottage that
she left at the disposal of her friends was what
Caroline, only five weeks removed from Cousin
Delia’s crowded quarters, would have called a
house, and a very nice one.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cottage, since Cousin Marcia wished to call
it so, was of gray, weathered shingles, with latticed
casements and a craftily contrived sag in the ridgepole,
and it stood in a little tangle of old-fashioned
flowers, on the side of a hill that sloped down to
the rocks and the sea. Inside there was a living
room, with a great brick fireplace and walls sheathed
in dark wood. The piano held the place of honor,
with its gleaming keyboard turned toward the windows.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a wee dining room, with cottage furniture
of black and yellow, and dishes black and yellow,
too. In the kitchen, all white and blue tiles,
was Cousin Marcia’s Jenny, a black woman who
went with the house and made beaten biscuit and
sugar jumbles, such as Caroline had never tasted
before. Upstairs were darling bedrooms, with
casements that looked to the sea. Caroline’s room
was all in delft blue and orange, like the sea in some
lights and the smooth western clouds when the sun
has just set.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were books in the house, and magazines,
and there were pretty things to sew, which Aunt
Eunice had brought along. Out of doors were the
downs, where Caroline went walking with a Cousin
Penelope who seemed younger and gayer and
lovinger than she had been in Longmeadow. There
were the rocks, with their treasure-pools of seaweed
and shells and strange live things that stayed rooted
or moved so sluggishly they barely seemed to move.
There were the white sands, where Caroline played
with a basket of new toys, fluted dishes, flower-shapes,
fish-shapes that molded the moist sand into
forms of beauty. There were the waves, where
Caroline paddled or sometimes, with little gasps
at the cold shock of them, ventured to bathe, and
bathed most willingly, when Cousin Penelope was
near.</p>

<p class='c009'>People came and went. Children from the near-by
cottages, all on the lordly scale of Cousin Marcia’s
dwelling, played with Caroline on the beach and
among the rocks. Lovely ladies, mothers and sisters
of the children, and all young alike, came to
tea with Aunt Eunice and Cousin Penelope, and
Caroline wore one of Jacqueline’s pretty frocks, the
corn-colored net or the hemstitched white crêpe de
chine with the old rose pipings, and passed the
Dresden plate of cakes or the silver dish of plump
bonbons.</p>

<p class='c009'>Madame Woleski came, not for a week, but for
three full days of enchantment, and made music for
them evenings in the soft light of the candles. She
kissed Caroline when she went away, and told her
she was mastering some of her faults of technique.
Let her work hard and not be discouraged! From
Madame Woleski that was much more than gushing
praises from another, and so the music-loving soul
in Caroline, that her mother had fostered, knew
and understood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wonderful days by the sea—days in which
Jacqueline in the Meadows was almost forgotten,
as Jacqueline herself had told Caroline to forget—days
indeed when Caroline almost believed that
she was Jacqueline, and that all this happiness
and love and the singing piano were to be hers
forever.</p>

<p class='c009'>There in Longmeadow, Jacqueline, helpless and
little, hadn’t known how to trace Caroline and the
Gildersleeves. But the postmaster had their new
address all the time! If Jacqueline had thought to
ask him, no doubt he would have told it to her, but
he would have told every one that she had asked
him, for he was the greatest old gossip in all the
village. No, she wouldn’t have dared to ask him,
because he was such a gossip, even if she had known
that he had the address.</p>

<p class='c009'>The William Gildersleeves, The Sheiling, Monk’s
Bay, Mass. That was the address, written in a
crabbed hand on a page in the postmaster’s notebook,
and to The Sheiling, Cousin Marcia’s cottage
at Monk’s Bay, came every now and then the letters
that he forwarded.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day there was a letter for Jacqueline Gildersleeve.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope handed it to Caroline, when she
came up from the beach to tea. Caroline was bare-legged,
in her sandals, with her brown pongee
knickerbockers, beneath her pongee smock, a little
dampened at the edges where she had been wading,
not wisely but too well. Under her broad-brimmed
straw hat with its tawny orange ribbons that matched
the orange stitching of her smock her face was
glowing and her eyes were wells of tranquil joy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s a letter from your aunt,” said Cousin
Penelope, in a vexed tone. “I really believe it’s the
first letter she has written you in all these weeks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice, in her basket chair by the open casement,
shook her head never so slightly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’ve sent her a great many post-cards,
Penelope,” she said, like one who makes an effort
to be just. “When you’re traveling all the time
from place to place, it isn’t always easy to write
regular letters, and besides you must remember that
mail often goes astray.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I didn’t ask for letters,” Caroline broke out,
in a trembling voice. “Oh, dear! You read it for
me, Aunt Eunice, please!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She had worn Jacqueline’s clothes, and borne
Jacqueline’s name, and taken Jacqueline’s place, but
there was something in her that she couldn’t overcome—something
that Mother and Father both had
trained—that cried out at the mere thought of opening
a sealed letter addressed to some one else.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Aunt Eunice had apparently the same feeling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly not, my dear,” she said, gently
enough, but in a tone that left no chance of appeal.
“You must read your own letter. It is meant for
you, and for nobody else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The glow had all gone out of Caroline’s face
and her eyes had filled. Now frankly she began to
cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Cousin Penelope who caught her in her
arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, there, precious!” she soothed. Think of
it! Cousin Penelope, of all people, soothing and
understanding. “I know how it is. Letters from
outside—they break things up——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it’s been so lovely here with you,” wept
Caroline, “just too lovely to last.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope held her tight—tight enough almost
to hurt her. Cousin Penelope kissed her, almost
passionately.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Penelope!” That was Aunt Eunice speaking,
but in a voice unlike her own voice—stern and hard.
“It is tea time. Jacqueline must wash her face and
hands. Jacqueline, my dear! Run upstairs and make
yourself tidy. Take your aunt’s letter with you, and
read it before you come down to tea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline obeyed, and no wonder, but Penelope—that
was the real wonder!—let her obey without a
word of protest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up in her room Caroline washed her face and
hands and feet, and brushed her hair. Then she
opened the envelope, because she was afraid to disobey
Aunt Eunice when she spoke in that stern
voice. The letter inside the envelope was thick,
but not very long, for Jacqueline’s Aunt Edith wrote
a big, sprawling hand. Caroline read it, and to her
relief found that it wasn’t so private as to make her
feel absolutely a horrid Paul Pry. Aunt Edith wrote
about some of the places she had seen, and spoke
of some gifts she was bringing to Jacqueline, and
hoped she had had a pleasant visit in Longmeadow,
and was glad that she and Uncle Jimmie were to see
her in another month, and that was all. Just all!</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline had been silly for nothing. She was to
have another month of happiness in beautiful
places with Cousin Penelope and Aunt Eunice, and
if the future could be judged by the past, probably
in all that blissful month Jacqueline’s Aunt Edith
wouldn’t write again! Caroline began to hum to herself,
like a drenched bee when the sun comes out,
while she put on her sand-colored socks and chose a
fresh ribbon for her hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Caroline at that moment (if you except
Jenny, who was buttering hot little tea-biscuits in
the kitchen) was the only tranquil person in Cousin
Marcia Vintner’s cottage.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the brown-sheathed living room Cousin Penelope
and Aunt Eunice exchanged distressed glances,
as soon as Caroline had fled from their presence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Penelope!” Aunt Eunice spoke as chidingly as
if Cousin Penelope were just a little girl again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t help it, Mother,” whispered Penelope.
“Jack’s child—the poor little thing—so happy with
us—like a different being since she came to us. You
can see it yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know,” Aunt Eunice sighed pitifully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What right has this Delane woman to take her
away from us?” Penelope asked fiercely. “She’s
starved her all these years—oh, of course I don’t
mean food, though her diet hasn’t been properly regulated,
and her teeth are in shocking condition. But
I mean the things a child needs more than food—books
and pictures and the music that’s more to that
little thing than the air she breathes. That Delane
woman doesn’t understand her as we do—she
doesn’t love her as we do——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, hush, Penelope!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the child doesn’t like her——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve no right to say that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to say it, Mother. You’ve seen it
yourself. Jacqueline never speaks of California or
her mother’s people. She wants to forget them.
She’s never written to them in all these weeks. She’s
barely glanced at the post-cards that woman has
sent—and you saw her just now when she got that
letter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the use of all this, Penelope? Edith is
her aunt, and one of her guardians. And the child
hasn’t been abused. Don’t conjure up horrors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Penelope bowed her white forehead into her long
slender hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t bear it!” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll have to bear it,” said Aunt Eunice in a
steady, calm voice. There were no tears in her old
eyes, but their patient look was very weary. “At
least we’ll get all the comfort we can out of the
weeks that are left. Four weeks at least she’ll be
with us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, we haven’t even that,” Penelope cried bitterly.
“They’ve changed their plans. I had a letter
from that woman in this same mail. They don’t
want to unsettle the child—as if they really cared!
We’re not to tell her. As if I would, under any
circumstances. Their dates are uncertain—it’s like
their selfishness to leave us in such cruel doubt.
They’ve cut their Alaskan trip short—fickle, stupid
people!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Penelope! Don’t!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t help it. I loathe them both. They’ll wire
us—oh, they’re so considerate! And they may turn
up in Longmeadow any day after next week—and
then they’ll take Jack’s little girl away from us!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXXII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXII<br /> <br />THE HORNS OF A DILEMMA</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Here were no cool sea breezes in the Meadows.
No sand toys, either, and even if there
had been, a big girl, going on eleven, in a house
where there was sickness, had no time to play.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline cooked and scrubbed and swept and
tended babies, and kept Neil and Dickie in their
places, too.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re the bossiest girl,” Neil protested with
some reason, more than once. “I wish you’d go
back to Chicago where you came from.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you’d get no more cookies,” Jacqueline
told him. “Aunt Martha hasn’t got time to make
’em for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There she had the whip-hand of them all. For
if she chose, she could give a fellow a broken cooky
hot from the pan, and if she didn’t choose—My,
you should have seen her the day she caught Neil
sneaking a cooky! Smack, smack went her brown
little hands, hardened in good outdoor exercise under
the California sun, and schooled (to Aunt Edie’s
horror!) in certain boxing tricks by the new Uncle
Jimmie. Neil sniffled with amazement and anger,
perhaps, more than with pain. But he didn’t tell
tales. They fought out their battles, he and Jacqueline,
and on the whole she gave him more cookies
than smacks.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was no joke, cooking in a hot kitchen, and
sleeping in a room, warmed through with the sun.
It was no picnic to be waked, just when the early
morning hours were cool and refreshing, by the gurgling
and cooing of Freddie and Annie, and to face
another day of endless step-stepping and chores that
never seemed done. But there were compensations.
Suppers, picnic fashion, to save washing dishes, in
the side-yard, or the orchard, or the knoll by the
river, where you could watch the sunset, while you
ate maple-sugar sandwiches and chunks of blueberry
cake. Berrying expeditions to far pastures,
with Ralph at the wheel of the Ford. A Sunday
School party in Longmeadow, where Jacqueline
felt as if she were at a masquerade in one of Caroline’s
faded, scanty ginghams and a freshly ironed
hair-ribbon, but ate her ice-cream (three plates of
it!) and two kinds of cake, as heartily as the uninvited
young man in the limerick.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course what made the summer weeks, with
their heat and hard work and meager pleasures, endurable
was the fact that Grandma Conway was all
the time getting better. Slowly, oh! very slowly, but
surely. Ever since the day when she found her beloved
old green-dragon cup at her lips once more,
she had shown an interest in life, and so she had
begun to live again. She sat up in bed now, and her
patient smile was like her old smile, and her eyes
twinkled and understood. You didn’t talk with her
long, for fear of tiring her, and the children still
played far from the house, so that she should not
be disturbed. But she was the least bit stronger
every day, and she began even to talk of the time
when she could leave her bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wish we had a wheelchair for her,” Aunt Martha
confided to Jacqueline over the peaches that they
were preserving, in the cool of the morning. “But
if wishes were horses, beggars might ride.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They wouldn’t want to ride to-day,” Jacqueline
replied. “They’d all want Lizzies, at the very
least.” To herself she made a promise:	“I’ll get
a wheelchair for Grandma—the best wheelchair in
all Boston—just as soon as Aunt Edie comes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For Aunt Edie and Uncle Jimmie had promised
to come in September. And if they didn’t keep to
their plans, well, at any rate Caroline would be coming
back from the beach, and Jacqueline would be
released from her promise, and have her clothes, and
her pocket money, and be able to do things again
in her old lordly way. She would do so many
things then to make Grandma and Aunt Martha
and the babies happy! She always dwelt upon their
happiness, when she counted the days to September.
She took great pains not to think about Caroline.
She had more than a suspicion that poor Caroline
was going to be anything but happy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Naturally since she was Aunt Martha’s right
hand and mainstay and dependence, Jacqueline didn’t
go often to the village, in those August days. Once
she rode to town with Ralph and Freddie, and at
the general store saw the youngster fitted to a pair
of new sneakers, a delicate task which she and Aunt
Martha had agreed was beyond Ralph’s masculine
capacity. Again she went to the village with the
four young Conways to the Sunday School party.
Then quite unexpectedly came her third opportunity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha was going to the north end of the
town to see Mr. Asa Wheelock, who might perhaps
lease a portion of her land next season. She meant
to stop on the way and buy a lot of little things
that were wanted at the house—cheesecloth, the
coarse kind that you need when you strain the nice
hot fruit juice that cools into jelly, bone buttons
for the children’s underwear, five yards of elastic
to run into little rompers, a spool of black sewing
silk and one of white cotton, and some boracic acid
and a cake of good white soap for Grandma, and a
box of talcum powder. Ralph never in the world
would get them right.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Aunt Martha’s little trip was called off, for
Mr. Asa Wheelock thoughtfully telephoned that
he had to drive south that afternoon, so he’d stop in
as he passed the Conway farm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’ll save just so much gas,” Aunt Martha
said in a pleased voice. You know the price of a
gallon of gasoline is worth considering, when there
is a long illness in a house where the income is
nonelastic. “But I did want that cheesecloth right
away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me go and get it,” volunteered Jacqueline,
eager for adventure. “Like as not I can beg a ride,
and if I can’t, why, I don’t mind the walk one little
bit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dickie was eager to go, too. The public library
would be open that afternoon, and he wanted to return
the Boy Scout book that he had finished, and
get out another. In the end Aunt Martha consented,
and off the two children started, as soon as
the dinner dishes were cleared away. They had not
walked half a mile, when they were overtaken by
a friendly Polish neighbor, and perched hazardously
on his running board, they reached the village
Post Office while the afternoon was still young.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dickie vanished into the public library, not to be
seen again till closing time, and Jacqueline went
about her errands. She bought the boracic and soap
and talc at Cyrus Hatton’s general store, and the
cheesecloth at the Post Office, but for the buttons
and elastic and thread she went into Miss Crevey’s
shop. She had had no call to go there since the
day when she pledged Caroline’s gold beads for
the precious dragon cup that had been such a life-bringer
to Grandma. She darted a glance at the
dusty secretary in the corner, and remembered how
she had watched Miss Crevey lock up the beads in
one of its drawers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Five yards of elastic,” chanted Miss Crevey,
as she measured off the commodity. “I’m all out o’
white, but black’s just as good, for it won’t show
anyhow. Can’t give you bone buttons that size, but
these smaller ones’ll slip into the button-holes ever
so much easier, and I won’t charge you no more.
Black silk? I’ll have some in next week, maybe.
But there’s plenty of thirty cotton. Hadn’t you better
take two spools as long as I have it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline thought not.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, there’s no suitin’ some folks,” muttered
Miss Crevey as she bundled up the small wares.
“By the way,” she made a sudden pounce, and Jacqueline
suspected that she had been making ready
to pounce ever since she saw her enter the shop,
“have you brought along the five dollars that you
owe me for that old cup?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Brought the five dollars?” Jacqueline echoed
blankly. Then she recovered from her amazement.
“Why, no,” she said sturdily. “I said I’d have the
money in September, and you said all right, and it
isn’t September yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve got some bills to meet,” said Miss Crevey,
in a resentful voice. “I need the cash right now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I haven’t got it,” Jacqueline repeated. “I
told you it would be September, and that suited you
all right, when you took the beads.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The beads ain’t no good to me,” said Miss Crevey.
Her sallow cheeks were reddened, and she
spoke very fast. “Cash is what I want, and what
I must have.” She hesitated the merest second.
“I’ve got a chance to sell them beads,” she launched
a thunderbolt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline stared at her. For a moment she could
do nothing but stare.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you can’t sell those beads,” she said in a
scared whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now look here,” Miss Crevey spoke on, in her
rapid, nervous voice. “I wouldn’t deceive you. I’ll
tell you just how ’tis. Mrs. Enos Trowbridge was
in here day before yesterday, and her cousin was
with her. They was looking at some old things I
got laying round, and they spied them beads tucked
away in the secretary. That cousin’s just set on having
’em. Seems they’re the identical same as some
old ones of her mother’s she lost in a fire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But she can’t have those beads!” Jacqueline
cried in a panic. “I won’t have it! Don’t you let
her!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wouldn’t cheat you,” Miss Crevey repeated
shrilly. “She’ll give me six dollars for ’em. I’ll
keep the five you owe me, and you shall have the
dollar for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her face was like flame as she snapped out the
words. Those bills that she must meet, the
wretched, driven, little old woman that she was!
She must think only of those bills. She mustn’t
admit even to herself that she was cheating a
child. For Mrs. Enos Trowbridge’s cousin had
offered her twenty-five dollars for those quaint old
beads.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can get yourself a whole lot of candy for a
dollar,” wheedled Miss Crevey.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I can’t,” said Jacqueline bluntly. “I
couldn’t get more than half a pound of decent candy.
And I don’t want candy, and I don’t want your old
dollar. I won’t have those beads sold. I never said
you could sell them. I won’t let you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you won’t, hey?” sneered Miss Crevey.
“How are you going to stop me, Miss?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll tell Aunt Martha,” said Jacqueline superbly.
“And I’ll tell the constable, maybe. You made me
a promise, and you’ve got no right to break it. You
can’t sell those beads.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Crevey’s flushed face was white, like the
white of a tallow candle. Jacqueline would never
know in all her days how that allusion to the constable
had struck terror to the very soul of the guilty,
worried little old woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Miss Crevey recovered herself quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess,” she sniffed, “I’ve wasted ’bout all the
time I mean to waste on a thankless, sassy young
one. You can just take your cheap brass beads off
my hands. I won’t have ’em cluttering up my
shop.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” said Jacqueline indignantly. “I’ll
be glad to take ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Crevey leaned across the counter and spoke
with a smile that parted her thin lips above her
false teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you can bring me back my cup,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a second the shop went spinning round Jacqueline.
How was it, she asked herself, that people
felt before they fainted dead away? At a great distance,
as it seemed to her, she heard her own voice
speaking:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—can’t. Don’t you <i>see</i>? Not that cup! Why,
it would <i>kill</i> Grandma.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Likely,” sneered Miss Crevey. She turned her
back elaborately and began to rearrange the articles
on her untidy shelves.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline clutched at the edge of the counter.
She really felt as if she were going to fall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You didn’t—mean that?” she implored.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Crevey wheeled about and faced her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mean it?” she cried. “Why shouldn’t I mean
it? What good are them beads doing me now?
You bring me back that good cup I let ye take, or
you let me sell them beads for what’s offered me,
or you bring me the five dollars, like you promised
me. I don’t care which ye do, but you got to do one
or t’other and do it quick.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There were footfalls on the worn step outside
the screen door, and the sound of women’s chattering
voices. No time to talk further, and no use in
talking!</p>

<p class='c009'>“You make up your mind before to-morrow
night,” bade Miss Crevey in a fierce whisper, “and
don’t ye go bawling and crying in here!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Fiercely Jacqueline blinked back the tears that
had gathered in her eyes. Proudly she turned her
back on Miss Crevey, and walked past the chattering
customers, out into the street.</p>

<p class='c009'>What was she going to do, she asked herself over
and over again, as she headed blindly homeward?
Take away Grandma’s cup? Ten thousand times,
<i>no</i>! Let Caroline’s beads be sold? Why, that was
to make herself a thief! Caroline’s precious beads
that she had kept hidden away with her mother’s
picture—Caroline’s mother’s beads—to let them be
sold would be almost as dreadful as to take Grandma’s
cup! And the only way to save the cup and
the beads from the ogreish Miss Crevey was to find
five dollars, somewhere, somehow before to-morrow
night.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no time to write to Judge Blair for the
money, even if Jacqueline had been willing at last,
in her desperate need, to betray the secret that was
one-half Caroline’s. There was no hope of reaching
Caroline. Jacqueline could go to Aunt Martha,
but Aunt Martha hadn’t any five dollars to spend
even for cups, and Aunt Martha, with all her cares
and troubles, mustn’t be worried. Only in the last
extremity could she turn to Aunt Martha. Only to-morrow
night, when every hope was surely gone.</p>

<p class='c009'>But before to-morrow night, somehow, she herself
must find the way out. How, she wondered desperately,
how? And while she wondered, she had
walked southward, like one in a daze, down Longmeadow
Street, and now, when she came to herself,
she realized that she was at the very gate of The
Chimnies. She paused and looked through the iron
grill work, and then, as if in answer to her un-worded
prayer for help, she saw that the shutters
were open, and the windows flung wide, and life at
last, and hope for her, had come into the silent house
again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXXIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXIII<br /> <br />IN THE HOUSE OF HER KINSFOLK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Jacqueline fairly ran up the steps to the
porch of The Chimnies. She was laughing in
queer little gasps which were very much like sobs.
Oh, but this was too good to believe! Right in
the nick of time, when she had to have help, and
didn’t know where on earth to find it!</p>

<p class='c009'>Rat-tat-tat, the knocker clanged gayly under her
hand. There were some bad minutes of explanation
ahead, perhaps, but like a session at the dentist’s,
they would be over some time and she would run
back with the money to that hateful shop, where
after to-day she would never set foot again. She
would thrust the money into Miss Crevey’s claws
and get back the beads. She would say something
polite, but oh! so cutting to Miss Crevey, and——</p>

<p class='c009'>The door opened before her into the dim hall
with its white paint, and gilt-framed mirrors, and
its staircase curving upward into cool distance. On
the threshold stood Sallie (only Jacqueline didn’t
know it was Sallie!) in a blue gingham dress, with
her sleeves tucked up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what is it?” asked Sallie brusquely. She
didn’t waste her company voice and manners on a
little girl in Peggy Janes and trodden sneakers, with
an armful of packages done up in brown paper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to see Car—I mean Jacqueline,” the real
Jacqueline corrected herself just in time. “The
little girl that lives here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She ain’t here now,” Sallie answered, with a carelessness
that seemed to poor Jacqueline downright
brutal. “She’s off to the beach.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But <i>you’re</i> here!” Jacqueline cried despairingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nobody said I wasn’t,” retorted Sallie. “Me
and Hannah Means got here to-day, to open up the
house, but the folks won’t be here till last of this
week or maybe first of next.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She started to shut the door, but she wasn’t able
to. For Jacqueline, at this last cruel blow, simply
slumped down on the threshold and let go the tears
that she had held back so long.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dumb it!” she wailed. You remember Jacqueline
usually cried more for anger than for sorrow.
“What’ll I do? Oh, sniveling opossums,
what’ll I do now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you can’t sit there crying,” said Sallie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can! I am!” howled Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter?” boomed a deep voice from
the hall behind them, and Hannah Means, the tried
and trusty cook at The Chimnies, bore down upon
them, with her head done up in a dust cloth. “What
young one’s that, Sallie? And whatever ails
her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline wept regardless. Sallie started to
shake her, but changed her mind and patted her
shoulder instead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you lost something?” asked Sallie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you got a stomach ache?” questioned Hannah,
in the same breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no!” sobbed Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you get a licking?” pursued Sallie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you hungry?” Hannah demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said Jacqueline, cross and ashamed of herself.
“I’m all right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sallie looked at her sharply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re one of the Conway children, ain’t you?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Guess she got tuckered out walkin’ up from the
Meadows,” Hannah suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two women exchanged glances.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You better sit and rest a spell here on the porch,”
Sallie bade Jacqueline, as she rose from beside her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come into the kitchen,” Hannah bettered the invitation.
“The grocery-boy’s just been here with
the things, and I can let you have a tumbler of milk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Shyness descended upon Jacqueline. She scrambled
to her feet, with a “No, thank you!” on the
tip of her tongue. But she never uttered it. For
once on her feet, she realized that she felt “all
gone.” Her knees were wobbly and there was a
fluttering in her wrists. Rest and a drink of milk
sounded good.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the guest of Hannah and Sallie, she passed
through the doorway of her great-aunt’s house,
and presently was seated in a rocker by the open
window of the big kitchen, with its enameled sink
and many cupboards. She slowly sipped the milk
that Hannah had poured for her into a thick glass.
She didn’t want to hurry. How should she ever
drag herself the hot miles home through the Meadows,
burdened with the weight of cares that Miss
Crevey’s threat had laid upon her?</p>

<p class='c009'>Other people had their troubles, too, she realized,
as she listened to Hannah’s grumbling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In one ear and out the other,” Hannah muttered,
as she unpacked the basket of groceries that
stood on the kitchen table. “Ain’t no use tellin’
folks nothin’ nowadays! I said saleratus, and
they’ve went and sent me salt, and there ain’t no
bacon, and they’ve forgot the molasses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s my cleaning powder?” sang out Sallie,
from the butler’s pantry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ain’t I tellin’ you?” cried Hannah. “They’ve
went and left out half the things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sallie bustled out from the pantry and did a little
inspecting on her own account.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No scouring soap—no cleaning powder—and no
scrubbing brush, like I ordered and you heard me,”
she said crossly. “Well, I can’t do nothing without
’em. I’ll phone and give ’em a piece of my
mind, and tell ’em they can just hustle those things
over—save ’em trouble if they’d done it in the first
place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lot o’ good ’twill do you to phone the store,”
scoffed Hannah. “They won’t send nothin’ over
till to-morrow. They’re independent as hogs on
ice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then here’s a whole afternoon wasted,”
snapped Sallie. “Goodness knows, <i>I</i> won’t walk up
to the store and fetch them things in this heat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline grabbed at opportunity with both
hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t mind the heat,” she cried. “I’ll run up
to the store and get your soap and things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’ll say that’s real nice of you,” conceded
Sallie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is,” stammered Jacqueline, “if you want to
pay me ten cents for going.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned as red as fire as she said the words.
She had never felt so awful in her life, and after
drinking the milk that these women had been kind
enough to give her. But she thought of Grandma,
without her cup! and Caroline, without her beads!
What was her own pride or even decency by comparison?
She just <i>had</i> to get some money.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, of all the nerve!” Hannah broke the
silence that seemed to Jacqueline to have lasted an
hour. “I’ll pay you ten cents to go—and you can
pay <i>me</i> ten cents for the milk you’ve drunk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline quailed. Grown-up people somehow
always had one at a disadvantage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going home now,” she quavered. “Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold on!” bade Sallie. “I’d rather pay a dime
than walk to the store and back, and I can’t let this
afternoon go wasted, when to-morrow like as not
will be a scorcher. You scoot up to the store and
fetch my things, and if you’re back in twenty minutes
you shall have your ten cents.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll run!” promised Jacqueline. She was all
smiles again, and at her smile Hannah melted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t let her run her legs off,” she boomed.
“And she can get me the saleratus while she’s about
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the well-worn Peggy Janes, Jacqueline went
sprinting back up the street. Hope was in her heart.
Ten cents wasn’t much, perhaps, but every little
bit added to every little bit you’ve got—and
she had until to-morrow night to make up the five
dollars!</p>

<p class='c009'>Promptly on the tick of ten minutes to three, she
pattered once more into the kitchen of The Chimnies.
In the basket that she tugged were scouring
soap and cleaning powder, a new yellow scrubbing
brush, a package of saleratus, a paper of bacon, and
even a can of molasses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” Sallie admitted, as she rocked in comfort,
“I’ll say it’s worth ten cents.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline blushed and pocketed the dime.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Crazy to earn money, ain’t ye?” said Hannah,
as she unpacked the basket. “What’s it for? Circus
coming to town?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I guess so.” Jacqueline answered vaguely.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sallie gathered up her soap and cleaning powder
but not with great enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m killed with a crick in my back that takes
me whenever I stoop,” she complained, and turned
to Jacqueline. “Look here, sister, d’ye know how
to scrub out a bathtub?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll say I do!” she answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s two bathrooms upstairs,” Sallie told
her. “I’ll give you another dime if you’ll go over
’em real good for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline stated her position, calmly and unashamed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s not enough. The Japs get fifty cents an
hour for cleaning, and I guess I’m as good as any
Jap.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s Japs got to do with it?” asked
Hannah. She, you’ll note, was not a Californian.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fifty cents an <i>hour</i>,” gasped Sallie. “<i>Fifty cents!</i>
Good-<i>night</i>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline decided that this was a time for compromise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” she admitted, “I’m not as big as a Jap,
so maybe I ought to come down on my price to <i>you</i>.
I’ll work for twenty-five cents an hour, not a cent
less, and I’m an awful good worker.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You won’t work for <i>me</i>,” said Sallie, with decision.
“What do you take me for? John D.
Rockerfeller?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline hesitated. She was torn between pride
and dire need.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d get both bathrooms done in an hour,” she
suggested. “I’m pretty spry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, now, let her!” Hannah struck in unexpectedly.
“If you break your back over them tubs, you’ll
be groaning all night and spoiling my rest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, if you’re sure you can do ’em in an hour,”
Sallie hesitated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Surest thing I do!” cried Jacqueline, all smiles.
“Let me get at ’em right away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eagerly she capered at Sallie’s heels up the back stairs.
Above was a long hall with doors at either
side, just the sort of hall that Jacqueline had expected
to find in Aunt Eunice’s house. Sallie pushed
open one of the doors, and led the way into a room
that was all cool gray and leaf-green with here and
there, in hangings and in wall-paper, a flash of
canary yellow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is the little girl’s room you was askin’ for,”
said Sallie. “Don’t you touch nothin’ now. Here’s
the bathroom, and t’other one is cross the hall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” Jacqueline answered stiffly. She
didn’t at all like the insinuation that she would touch
things. “Give me the cleaning rags, and I’ll go to
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment Sallie lingered, until she was sure
that Jacqueline was attacking the nickel and enamel
in a professional manner. Then with a parting hint
that Jacqueline would have to work fast, if she
expected to finish in an hour, she went away downstairs,
and Jacqueline was left in possession of the
second story.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had no time to feel lonely in those empty
rooms. She was too busy to think. She scrubbed
and she polished, while the perspiration ran down
her face, and her fingers grew stiff and gritty from
the soap and the coarse powder that she used. When
she rose at last, and looked down at the shining
tub and the clean tiling of the floor, she felt some
sympathy with poor Sallie. She too, had a “crick
in her back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Through the open door into the bedroom she
glimpsed the green and gold of the chintz curtains,
the dressing-table, with its lady pin-cushion and its
dainty china boxes, the comfortable, low rocker beside
the well-filled bookshelves. So that was Caroline’s
room—the room that rightfully was hers!</p>

<p class='c009'>Smiling somewhat ruefully, Jacqueline tiptoed
across the threshold and, planted on the oyster
white rug, stood gazing about her. This might all
have been hers—this soon would be hers. She
would sleep in that cozy, soft bed, with no fretful
children to disturb her. She would rise in the morning
and dress. Her clothes would hang, no doubt,
behind that door, which was all one mirror.</p>

<p class='c009'>She bowed to the reflection in the mirror—the
sunburnt, rough-haired, little brown girl in Peggy
Janes and venerable sneakers. Then she opened
the door and peeped into the closet. Why, here
were some of her dresses, of net, and organdie, and
gingham, her riding clothes, her boots. She chuckled
to herself. What faces Hannah and Sallie would
wear, if she should put on her clothes—her own
clothes!—and go down the stairs, and appear before
them. Well, very soon she would!</p>

<p class='c009'>But before that day came—oh, what might not
happen! All her troubles thronged back upon her,
and to think that she must suffer so much, for what
always before in her life she had thought a little
sum of money! If only she had now one of the five-dollar
bills that she had often wasted! If she could
open her little vanity bag, and find in it some
money—her own money!</p>

<p class='c009'>Fascinated with the thought, she stepped into the
closet, and looked to see if one of her little bags
were perhaps hanging from the hooks. Of course
not! She might have known that fussy little Caroline
would put them carefully into a drawer, as she
herself had always been told to do. She came out
of the closet, and softly closed the door, and hurried
to the bureau. Without scruple—for weren’t
these things all her own, and the room meant for
her?—she opened the drawers and hastily peeped
in. She found only one of her bags, the gray one
with beads, and it was quite empty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Disappointed, she closed the drawer, and with
a sigh turned away. Once more she saw her reflection
in the mirror of the dressing-table, and hesitatingly
she drew near. She hadn’t been able half to
see herself in the wavering looking glass at the
farm. My, but she had put on a great coat of tan
this summer!</p>

<p class='c009'>From the reflection in the mirror, her eyes
dropped to the pretties on the dressing-table. Little
boxes and toys of Dresden china—delicate, dainty
things. She touched them lightly—as Sallie had told
her not to do. Sallie, indeed! She guessed she had
the right. She lifted the cover of the little trinket
box that she was fingering, and there, coiled in its
white depths, a chain of gold beads—her own gold
beads—twinkled up at her.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXXIV' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXIV<br /> <br />A BUSINESS TRANSACTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>At five minutes after four Jacqueline appeared in
the kitchen. In her hand she carried the tin
housemaid’s assistant, with its soap and powder,
rags and nickel polish.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve finished,” she announced briefly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hannah looked down from the step-ladder, where
she was standing to clean the cupboard shelves.
Sallie poked her head out from the butler’s pantry,
where she seemed totally surrounded with hot soap-suds
and china dishes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I bet you give ’em a lick and a promise,” she
said morosely. “I’m going up and see for myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Up the stairs she went, while Jacqueline stood
pawing with impatience.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better sit down,” boomed Hannah, from the
step-ladder. “You must be plumb tuckered out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t,” said Jacqueline. “I’m in an awful
hurry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She gathered up her brown paper parcels, with
nervous, eager fingers. Why didn’t Sallie hurry
back? Could it be that she—suspected something?
Oh, blithering kangaroos! She didn’t want explanations
now, and with Sallie, of all people.</p>

<p class='c009'>But explanations were not needed. Down came
Sallie in due season, with nothing worse to grumble
over than the misery in her back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ain’t done such a bad job,” she conceded,
as she doled two dimes and a nickel into Jacqueline’s
hard little palm. “Say, don’t you want to
come round again to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, thanks,” Jacqueline answered carelessly.
“I’ve got all I can do at home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told you so,” chuckled Hannah. “Money
enough for the circus, and then she quits.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline barely heard her. Over her shoulder
she called good-by, and in two jumps she was out
at the back door, and down the steps. Almost running,
she hurried across the garden toward the
short-cut that would bring her most quickly into
Longmeadow Street. She was heading for Miss
Crevey’s shop, and in the pocket of her Peggy Janes
was a string of gold beads.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course she had a perfect right to them, for
they were her very own. She would give them in
exchange for Caroline’s beads, and so the green-dragon
cup would be safe, and Caroline’s beads
would be safe, and Miss Crevey would have <i>more</i>
than the five dollars that had been promised her.
For Jacqueline’s beads were worth ten dollars. She
knew, for she had bought them herself, Christmas
before last, with the check that her mother’s cousin
had sent her from Honolulu.</p>

<p class='c009'>But would that disagreeable Miss Crevey consent
to the exchange? Jacqueline asked herself the question
with a sinking heart, about the time she reached
the gap in the hedge. For Miss Crevey wanted
ready money, and Mrs. Enos Trowbridge’s cousin,
who had offered cash for Caroline’s ancient beads,
would not give it perhaps for beads that were
modern.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, slithy alligators!” groaned Jacqueline, and
paused disheartened in the short-cut, while she asked
herself: what next!</p>

<p class='c009'>Then from the swing that hung from a branch of
the big elm in the Trowbridge garden, a shrill voice
hailed her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello!” cried Eleanor Trowbridge.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline turned and across the rose tangle surveyed
the stout child with disfavor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Lo yourself!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eleanor sprang from the swing and came up to
the rose tangle, all ready to be entertained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you want to see Jacqueline?” she asked
cheerily, “Well, she isn’t home yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t I know it, smarty?” Jacqueline answered
crossly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Smarty yourself!” retorted Eleanor, and turned,
but she didn’t walk away.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the afternoon she had been alone in the garden,
forbidden to have playmates, because her
grandmother was giving a bridge-party in the house,
and mustn’t be disturbed with the shouts of children,
and now she was really dying for some one to talk to.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My grandmother’s having a party,” she told Jacqueline,
by way of resuming cordial relations.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t stop her,” Jacqueline answered rudely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>I</i> had a party yesterday.” Eleanor turned to her
eagerly. “I was ten years old. I don’t suppose
<i>you</i> ever had a party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t get fresh,” cautioned Jacqueline. “I’ve
had more parties than ever you’ve had. I’ve had
dozens of them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps the party hadn’t improved Eleanor’s
temper. The day after, as we all know, is apt to be
trying. At any rate she looked at Jacqueline’s
shabby clothes, and was so snobbish and ill-mannered
as to sneer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dozens of parties? I don’t believe you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t have to,” snapped Jacqueline. “And
I don’t have to believe you had a party yesterday,
and I don’t, so there!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did, too,” said Eleanor. “And I had lots of
presents. I guess you’d believe me, if you saw
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I saw ’em, maybe,” Jacqueline tantalized.
She didn’t know why she should pause at that moment
to tease Eleanor, but there was something
about Eleanor’s pink and white complacency that
rubbed her the wrong way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You crawl through the gap here, and I’ll show
you.” Eleanor accepted her challenge. “Come
on—unless you’re scared to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That was a dare, so Jacqueline promptly
scrambled through the rose tangle and found herself in
the Trowbridge garden. In the moment of her
arrival the paper bag that held her Crevey purchases
broke, and the bone buttons, a size too small
cascaded to the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You pick ’em up,” bade Eleanor, “and I’ll go
get some of my things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>If it hadn’t been for those fateful buttons, Jacqueline
would very likely have posted off to Miss
Crevey’s, and left Eleanor without regrets. But
she had to recover the buttons, every one of them,
and before she had picked up the last of them,
Eleanor came panting back.</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time Eleanor had forgotten that she and
Jacqueline were on snappish terms. She was just
a roly-poly child, eager to show her new treasures to
another child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See here,” she said, as she plumped down on the
turf beside Jacqueline, and displayed the articles
which she lugged in the slack of her skirt, “this is
scent, real grown-up scent, and the bottle that it’s
in is cut glass. This cunning brush and comb and
mirror set is for my doll—my biggest French doll.
Have you got a doll?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sick of dolls,” yawned Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You wouldn’t be,” Eleanor told her patronizingly,
“if you had a doll with real hair, like my
Gladys. I had a chair for her, too, and a bed, but
they were too big to bring out here, and a parlor
set for my doll-house. I had this ring—it’s a
scarab. And this seal for my envelopes, and some
sealing-wax, all colors, and some teeny-weeny candles.
And here’s a handbag, with a purse and a
mirror. Have you ever had a handbag?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure,” Jacqueline told her languidly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eleanor opened the little red leather bag. Clearly
enough, she was proud of the pretty gift. She took
out the little mirror, and the wee brown handkerchief,
sown with red rosebuds, and showed them to
Jacqueline. Last of all, she took out the little red
leather purse, and opened it, and disclosed a folded
bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s my five dollars from Grandpa,” she explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline forgot to be languid. Distinctly she
sat up and took notice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Five dollars!” she repeated enviously. “What
you going to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I d’ know,” admitted Eleanor. “Buy me some
silver bangles, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t want bangles,” Jacqueline declared
with finality. “They slip down over your hand and
get in your way all the time. I should think——”
She hesitated, as one about to make a desperate
plunge. “I should think you’d much rather buy a
chain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, maybe I will,” Eleanor said vaguely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A chain of gold beads would be nice, don’t you
think?” Jacqueline spoke in honeyed accents. “Have
you got any gold beads?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” confessed Eleanor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everybody ought to have gold beads,” Jacqueline
laid down a law that she had invented on the
spur of the moment. “Most all the girls I knew
at school had gold beads—all the big ones, that is,
of course, the little third and fourth graders
didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going into the fifth grade,” Eleanor said
quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you have some gold beads when you go back
to school,” suggested Jacqueline, “the others will
all be just green with envy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eleanor wavered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess perhaps I will get me beads,” she said,
and snapped the purse upon the precious five dollars.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You haven’t got much time before school opens,”
Jacqueline insinuated. “And you can’t buy good
beads in Longmeadow, or in Baring Junction,
either.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe we’ll go to Boston next week,” Eleanor
said hopefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline dared all.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have some gold beads,” she said, and took the
golden strand from the pocket of the Peggy Janes,
and dangled them before Eleanor’s astonished eyes.
“Say, aren’t they crackerjacks?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on!” sniffed Eleanor. “They’re brass from
the ten-cent store.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Much you know about beads!” scoffed
Jacqueline. “Just you look at that clasp, with a real pearl
in it. Fourteen carat gold those beads are, and
they cost ten dollars. I got ’em Christmas before
last.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eleanor fingered the beads with a reverence that
was tinged with envy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can’t buy beads like that for any measly
five dollars,” Jacqueline told her patronizingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, who says I want to?” Eleanor told her,
but with a half-heartedness that was not lost on Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here!” said Jacqueline, like one conferring
a favor. “Since you can’t get to Boston to buy your
beads before school opens, maybe I’ll sell you mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t want ’em!” muttered Eleanor, but she still
kept the beads in her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They cost ten dollars,” Jacqueline said honestly,
“but you can have ’em for five, because I want the
money, and look here, if you don’t like ’em after
all, I’ll buy ’em back from you next week.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eleanor began to sparkle with interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you, really and honest?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, sure,” said Jacqueline heartily. “You
give me the five dollars, and you can keep the beads,
and wear ’em all you like—they’ll be yours, you
know—and then if you get tired of ’em, and want
your silly old bangles after all, why, you can have
your money back. That’s fair, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, yes,” admitted Eleanor, swept off her feet,
as Caroline had been swept on an earlier occasion,
as you’ll remember, by Jacqueline’s sheer force of
will.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” Jacqueline caught her up. “You’ve
got the beads, now give me the money. I’ve got to
beat it home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She fairly took the bag from Eleanor’s bewildered
hands, and scooped the green bill from its
resting place.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Remember!” she said. “Next week, if you
don’t like the beads.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she scrambled to her feet, with the bill
clutched in her hand, and before the dazed Eleanor
had time to change her mind was off through the
short-cut, and speeding toward Miss Crevey’s shop,
and Caroline’s gold beads, and relief from all the
cares and worries that beset her.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXXV' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXV<br /> <br />ELEANOR JOINS THE PARTY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Half an hour later Jacqueline was trudging
stoutly through the powdery dust of the Meadows
road. She was hardly conscious of the dust
or the heat. She forgot that she was tired, and
likely to be tireder before she reached the farm.
For safe in her pocket she carried the precious gold
beads that were Caroline’s, redeemed from Miss
Crevey’s pokerish black drawer. She could chuckle
to herself, as she remembered the cold, polite fashion
in which she had laid down the five-dollar bill, and
asked to have them back, and the chagrin in Miss
Crevey’s sallow face as she complied—what else
could she do?—and handed them over.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All’s well that ends well,” Jacqueline told herself
happily.</p>

<p class='c009'>Right at that same hour, five by the clocks of
Longmeadow, Eleanor Trowbridge walked into her
grandmother’s long parlor, where the eight ladies
who had made up the bridge-party were eating
macaroon ice-cream and frosted cakes, and talking
excitedly of doubles and slams. Eleanor was
sniffling, with the very evident desire to attract attention
and sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, darling, what’s the matter?” cried young
Mrs. Wheeler Trowbridge, who was Eleanor’s
mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Use your handkerchief!” bade Mrs. Enos Trowbridge,
who was Eleanor’s grandmother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re—broken,” whined Eleanor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s broken? Let me look, sweet pettie,”
coaxed Mrs. Wheeler Trowbridge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She said they were nice beads,” Eleanor declared
her wrongs, “but they aren’t a bit nice.
They’re horrid old ten-cent brass beads, and the
clasp is broken.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Wheeler Trowbridge took Jacqueline’s
string of beads from Eleanor’s grubby hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, honey-bird,” she said, “these beads can’t
be brass, with a clasp like this. They’re beautiful
gold beads. Where did you get them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was the little girl from down in the Meadows,”
said Eleanor, delighted to find that all the
ladies were listening to her, at last. “She was over
at The Chimnies. She’s always hanging round there,
looking for Jacqueline, and she said the beads were
worth ten dollars, but she’d let me have ’em for five,
and I gave her my five dollars that Grandpa gave
me, and she ran right off, and now I want my money
back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She began to sniffle again. But she had lost the
center of the stage. The ladies, in their crisp summer
silks and organdies, were chattering all at once
like magpies, and it was not about Eleanor that they
chattered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One of those shabby Meadows children, with
gold beads to dispose of?” cried Mrs. Judge Holden.
“Well, I never!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are really good beads,” said Mrs. Enos
Trowbridge’s Boston cousin, with the air of one
who knew beads intimately.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where could the child have got them?” asked
Mrs. Wheeler Trowbridge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And she wanted to get rid of them in a hurry,”
darkly hinted Miss Selina Fanning, who was a great
reader of detective stories.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you want to know what I think,” said Mrs.
Enos Trowbridge, in her positive manner, “I call
it suspicious—very suspicious.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then, when they were all a-flutter with excitement,
Mrs. Enos Trowbridge’s “second girl,”
whose name was Angeline, came hurrying into the
long parlor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope you’ll excuse the liberty, Mis’ Trowbridge,”
she said, as excited as the bridge ladies
themselves, and as pleased to be excited, “but Sallie
Macumber from Mis’ Gildersleeve’s wants to phone
here, ’cause their phone is out of order, and it’s
awful important.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, of course,” said Mrs. Enos Trowbridge,
not too graciously. “Tell her she can come in. I
suppose it’s a case of sickness,” she told her guests
apologetically.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sallie, all red with excitement, fluttered into the
long room, and fluttered toward the desk where the
telephone stood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excuse me, ladies,” she spoke shrilly. “I’m
sorry to disturb you, I’m sure, but our phone won’t
work, and I’ve got to get the constable right away
this minute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Constable?” repeated Mrs. Enos Trowbridge,
and lost her frigid dignity. “Why, Sallie, what’s
the matter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mis’ Trowbridge!” cried Sallie, delighted
to unburden herself. “Me and Hannah are so upset!
There’s been thieves in our house, sure as
you’re sitting there. I didn’t get round to the side-board
drawers till just a little while ago—and there
was a dozen silver teaspoons I tucked in under some
napkins, the day we shut up the house, and they’re
<i>gone</i>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my soul!” gasped Mrs. Wheeler Trowbridge,
and clutched Eleanor, as if she thought she,
too, might go the way of the vanished spoons.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we just glanced an eye round the place,”
Sallie went on, in a voice that grew shriller with
every word she uttered, “and a lot of little silver
things are gone from Miss Penelope’s desk, and the
snuff-box from the parlor table, and all the little
hand-painted knick-knacks Miss Penelope kept in her
glass cabinet, and there was some beads of Jacqueline’s
I put away myself in a box, the day she left,
and they’re gone, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What sort of beads?” said Miss Selina Fanning.</p>

<p class='c009'>You could feel the silence in the room, while the
ladies, who no longer rustled, waited for her answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gold beads,” Sallie answered, and I’m afraid
that that was what they secretly were hoping she
would answer!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you know them if you saw them again?”
Miss Selina pursued.</p>

<p class='c009'>The others looked at her in admiration. Why,
she was just as good as a man, and a lawyer!</p>

<p class='c009'>“You better believe I’d know them beads,” cried
Sallie. “I’ve seen Jacqueline wear ’em many a time.
One big long bead, and then a little round bead, and
a real pearl set in the clasp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dramatically Miss Selina took the beads from the
Boston cousin, and waved them under Sallie’s eyes,
which grew as round as saucers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are these the beads?” asked Miss Selina, in a
hollow whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sallie glanced at them, clutched them, then
looked round awestricken at the intent faces of
the ladies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re Jacqueline’s beads, as sure as apples
grow on trees,” she said. “However did they get
here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The ladies rustled and whispered. Only Mrs.
Enos Trowbridge spoke aloud, portentously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some one sold them to my grand-daughter—sold
them for a song—and mark my word, the person
who was so eager to get rid of them, may know
something about the other things that are missing
from your house.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXXVI' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXVI<br /> <br />CORNERED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The next day was a scorcher, even as Sallie
had foretold, but Jacqueline “flaxed round,”
as Grandma called it, and had her baking done by
nine o’clock. She found the work mere play, because
she was light-hearted. What else should she
be, with Caroline’s beads safe upstairs in the old
lacquer box, and Great-aunt Eunice coming back the
last of this week or the first of next, and everything
about to end happily? She was going to have great
fun, looking back on this strange summer. As to
Caroline—oh, well, Caroline had had the time of
her life, and she’d get used to the farm pretty soon.
After all, in this world one can’t have everything—which
is a comforting reflection, and especially so
to those who have a great deal!</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha came into the kitchen, about nine
o’clock, with her hands all grimy, where she had
been working in the garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just keep an eye on the babies, will you, Jackie?”
she said, as she filled the blue enamel basin at the
sink. “It’s too hot for them to run about in the
sun and Nellie can’t always manage ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Jacqueline took the mending basket and went
out into the side-yard, where the trees cast a strong
shadow, if one had the sense to stay in it, and there
was a ripple of wind—hot but at least stirring—which
came across the onion fields from the western
mountains.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline sat in the old weather-beaten hammock,
and darned stockings, and sewed on buttons
while Nellie and Freddie and Annie played at her
feet with two cups that had lost their handles,
seventeen spools, and a headless toy horse. Presently,
as the sun rose higher and work in the garden
grew out of the question, Dickie and Neil came
and dropped in the shade, like panting puppies.
Dickie had his Boy Scout book; but Neil had nothing
to do but whittle with his single-bladed jackknife.</p>

<p class='c009'>Last of all came Ralph, with the leather strap
collar that he wanted to mend for the brown bossy.
He sat on the ground, tailor fashion, and punched
holes in the stiff leather with a stout awl, and made
terrible faces over the work, but Jacqueline knew
better than to laugh at him. He was a frightfully
serious person, that Ralph.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were all busy in the shade, with their work
or their play, when a dusty roadster came chirring
down the road from the village, and of all things,
turned in at the Conway farm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gee!” said Ralph. “If that isn’t Judge Holden.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He uncoiled himself and rose from the ground,
and hobbling, because one foot had gone to sleep,
hurried over to the kitchen door where the roadster
had come to a stop. Jacqueline saw him open the
door of the car, and wait for its occupant to alight,
and then she saw a tall old gentleman, clean shaven,
in dusty gray clothes, step spryly out, and pat
Ralph’s shoulder, as he greeted him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha must have heard or seen the car
turn into the yard, for she appeared now at the
kitchen door, a little flurried, with her apron off.
Judge Holden shook hands with her, and then they
both went into the house, and Ralph came back into
the shadow of the trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What does the Judge want?” asked Neil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He said you’d got to come to his court in Baring,”
Ralph answered, with a perfectly sober face,
“’cause you cut cross Deacon Whitcomb’s field, after
Mother said not to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“G’on,” Neil scoffed, but in an anxious voice.
“The Judge never said any such thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Much you know what he said!” retorted Ralph,
as he took up his strap and his awl, and fell to work
once more.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, did he say that—honest?” Neil began to
whine. “Honest Injun?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Course he didn’t, you big baby,” Dickie broke
in. “Ralph’s just stringing you. I guess the Judge
wants Mother to sign something about the wood lot
or something.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is he Aunt Martha’s lawyer?” Jacqueline asked
innocently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’d you get that stuff?” said Dickie. “He
isn’t anybody’s lawyer. He’s about the biggest man
in town.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s a good scout,” Ralph interrupted. “He’s
done lots of things for us since Father died.” He
bit his lip with the effort of jabbing the awl through
the tough leather, and then resumed: “Mother and
Father both went to school to him, when he was a
young fellow, working his way through college.
Your father went to school to him, too, Jackie.
Some day,” Ralph added, “I’m going to read law
in his office.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t want you to be a judge,” Nellie burst
out. “I don’t want you to go putting folks in
jail.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you behave yourself,” Neil admonished,
“and he won’t never put you there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the implication that she might otherwise land
some day in jail, Nellie began to whimper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aw, you big cheese, stop teazing the kid!” cried
Dickie.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he and Neil began to maul each other, regardless
of the heat, and Nellie, quite forgetful of
the fact that Dickie was her champion, went to help
Neil who was getting the worst of it. She got hit
on the nose, quite accidentally, but none the less she
began at once to cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the confusion of soothing Nellie and scolding
the boys, Jacqueline and Ralph didn’t hear Aunt
Martha call. But Freddie heard and cried:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look-it! Look-it! Auntie at the window!”</p>

<p class='c009'>They looked, and there was Aunt Martha, at
the open window of the dining room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jackie!” she called clearly. “Come here,
Jackie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re the one that’s going to jail,” laughed
Neil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Chase yourself!” Jacqueline laughed back at
him, and put down her mending basket, and trotted
off to the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Did he want to see her, this strange old gentleman,
because he had taught the father of the little
girl she was supposed to be? Or did he want
to see her because—Oh, could Caroline have told
Aunt Eunice, and could Aunt Eunice have written
to this man, who was “the biggest man in town”
to set things straight?</p>

<p class='c009'>With her heart quite thudding at the pleasurable
thought, Jacqueline padded across the clean, familiar
kitchen, and into the dining room. The table
stood set for the simple dinner. The blinds were
half drawn, and the light in the room, that came
sifting through the leaves outside, was goldy green.
Jacqueline blinked a second, and then made out the
face of the Judge, grave, expressionless, all but the
keen eyes that instantly sought her, from where he
sat in the big rocker by the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is Henry’s little girl,” Aunt Martha spoke
in a voice that was strangely flat, not like Aunt Martha’s
voice at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline glanced at her curiously. How white
and queer Aunt Martha looked, she thought to herself,
but perhaps it was only because of the dim,
queer light in the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you’re Caroline Tait, are you?” said the
Judge, with his steady eyes upon her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline bobbed a curtsy. That wasn’t saying
yes to his question, so she hadn’t told a fib.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sit down,” bade the Judge, just as if it were
his house, instead of Aunt Martha’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline sat down in the spiral rocker opposite
him, with her dusty sneakers swinging clear of
the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You go to school, Caroline?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Judge,” said Jacqueline. “I’m going into
the seventh grade next month.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you go to Sunday School?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Judge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you’ve been taught to tell the truth, always?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure,” said Jacqueline, in a steady voice, but as
she spoke she locked together the hands that had
been resting idly in her lap. What was he driving
at, in his roundabout, grown-up way? Did he
know about Caroline’s gold beads? But she had
put them back, safe in the box.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Caroline,” the Judge spoke gravely, “I
want you to take your time and tell your aunt and me
just what you did yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline darted a look about her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be afraid, Jackie,” Aunt Martha spoke
up. “Tell us just what happened. I know you
haven’t any call to be afraid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline unclasped her hands on her lap, and
clasped them tight again. She was ashamed to feel
how they were trembling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I went up to the village with Dickie,” she said,
“in Mr. Zabriski’s car, and I did some errands for
Aunt Martha at Cyrus Hatton’s, and the Post Office,
and Miss Crevey’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you came straight home, didn’t you?” Aunt
Martha struck in eagerly. “Didn’t you, Jackie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Judge held up his hand, and frowned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you please, Martha! Let her tell the story
her own way. Where did you go then, Caroline?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I came down Longmeadow Street,” Jacqueline
went on cautiously. Whatever he was up to, this
Judge, she wasn’t going to give away the secret that
she shared with Caroline! “I stopped at the William
Gildersleeve place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha drew a quick breath. The Judge
gave her a warning glance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I knocked at the door,” Jacqueline went on,
“and I asked to see the little girl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I knew her on the train, coming from
Chicago,” Jacqueline answered, feeling her way. “She
wasn’t there, but the maids were real kind, because
I was tired. They asked me in, and they gave me
a drink of milk, and I ran an errand to the store,
and Sallie gave me ten cents, and she had a crick in
her back so I did up both the bathrooms for her,
for twenty-five cents, and the money is upstairs in
my pocket-book this very minute, Aunt Martha.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked hopefully at Aunt Martha, but Aunt
Martha sat with her eyes cast down, and her hands
on her lap pressed tight together.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—see!” said the Judge. He sat leaning on
one elbow, with his chin in his hand and his deep-set
eyes never once wavering from Jacqueline’s face.
“Well, when you left the house, what next?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I crawled through the hole in the hedge, and I
saw the fat little girl next door, and she said hello.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was that all?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She showed me her birthday presents.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And then——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Was she going to reveal anything that would
“give away” her transaction with Caroline’s beads?
Not Jacqueline!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I went back to Miss Crevey’s,” she said
calmly, “after something I’d forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you didn’t see the fat little girl again?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Judge, I came right straight home from
Miss Crevey’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Judge Holden’s gray eyebrows drew together in
a frown. Jacqueline squirmed beneath his
relentless scrutiny. She turned for relief to Aunt Martha,
and was dismayed to see the misery in her white
face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, what’s it all about?” cried Jacqueline defensively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look at me!” said the Judge. “You haven’t
told us everything, have you, Caroline? Think a
little now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Jackie, tell us all about it!” Aunt Martha
burst out with a sharp cry. “You found them, didn’t
you? And you didn’t realize——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tut, tut! Martha!” the Judge interposed sternly.
“You know you promised. Now, Caroline, when
this little fat girl showed you her presents, there
was a handbag among them, wasn’t there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline nodded. She felt her face growing
red. Not with fright or shame, and that old Judge
needn’t think it. She was just getting mad clear
through, as she realized the treachery with which
Eleanor had treated her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There was a five-dollar bill in the bag, wasn’t
there?” the Judge went on. “And she gave it to
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll say she did!” cried Jacqueline. “The horrid
little sneaking tell-tale!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hm!” said the Judge. “Gave you a five-dollar
bill, did she? What for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline looked Judge Holden straight in the
face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If that bawl-baby says I cheated her, it isn’t
so,” she cried. “I gave her some gold beads, and
they’re worth more than her nasty old five dollars.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the second that followed Jacqueline heard
Aunt Martha draw a quick breath. But she couldn’t
turn to look at her. She was watching the Judge,
and wondering why he should put his hand into the
pocket of his coat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad you told us this, Caroline,” he said.
“You see, the little girl told her mother, and her
mother told me all about it. Are these the beads
you gave her for five dollars?”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the identical yellow strand—her own beads—that
he drew from the pocket of his dusty gray
coat. Jacqueline cast one careless glance at them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Judge’s voice was patient, and quite gentle:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where did you get them, Caroline?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline looked from the Judge to Aunt Martha,
and caught Aunt Martha’s bloodless lips shaping
the one word: “Found——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Martha, if you please!” the Judge fairly thundered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I did find them, so there!” cried Jacqueline.
“And you needn’t yell at Aunt Martha, even
if you <i>are</i> a judge. They were in the china box in
the bedroom next to the bathroom at the Gildersleeves’,
you know, and I took them——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Took them?” Aunt Martha’s voice was no more
than a gasp of pain and dismay. “Oh, no, Jackie!
No!” She hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline rose to her feet, bewildered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aunt Martha! Don’t!” she quavered. “Aunt
Martha!” She fairly whimpered the last words,
as she flung her arms round Aunt Martha. In half
a minute she knew she was going to cry and it was
all that hateful Judge’s fault.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha put her arms round Jacqueline and
held her close.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Judge!” she said. “There’s some mistake—I
can’t believe it even now. She’s coming down
sick or something—she didn’t understand—she never
took them wilfully. Jackie! Tell us everything!
I can’t stand it to have folks calling you a thief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline stiffened in Aunt Martha’s arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me—a thief?” she cried furiously. “They’d
better not call me that. Why, Aunt Martha, don’t
you ever dare think so! Don’t you let ’em make
you think so!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha was crying—actually crying!
Aunt Martha! Oh, but that couldn’t be allowed.
At any cost, even a broken promise to Caroline!
What did Caroline matter now? It was Aunt Martha
who counted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t! Don’t!” wailed Jacqueline and clasped
Aunt Martha tight. “Don’t you cry, Aunt Martha!
There’s nothing to cry about. I didn’t steal those
beads—they’re my <i>own</i> beads! I’ll tell you all about
it, if you won’t cry. It’s all right, Aunt Martha—because
I’m <i>not</i> Caroline Tait at all—I’m Jacqueline
Gildersleeve.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXXVII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXVII<br /> <br />ONE WAY OUT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Shakespeare speaks in one of his plays of
the disastrous position of the man who is blown
up with the bomb he has himself touched off. Jacqueline
was not nearly so well acquainted with
Shakespeare as Caroline was. But one half-second
after she made her startling announcement, she
needed no poet to tell her how that poor man felt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha stared for that one half-second,
and then a look of actual triumph came flooding into
her tear-stained face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, Judge!” she cried, with her arms tight
about Jacqueline. “Doesn’t that prove what I kept
telling you? It’s the awful heat—and she’s worked
so hard and faithful, poor young one—and that long
walk yesterday in the sun—it’s gone to her head.
You can see for yourself she doesn’t know what she
does—or what she says.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline stood speechless, (“flabbergasted,”
Grandma would have called it!) while she looked
from Aunt Martha’s excited, anxious, yet beaming
face, to the Judge who sat coldly, shrewdly watching.
Crowding into her brain came memories she
had laid aside, passages and chapters in the latter
portion of that fateful volume, “The Prince and
the Pauper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, pluffy catamounts!” she almost shrieked in
terror. “Don’t you go acting like those silly boobs
in that beastly old book—don’t you go thinking
I’m off my head, because I’m not—I’m not! I’m
Jacqueline—and I never was anybody else! I’m Jacqueline
Gildersleeve!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She began to cry, tears of temper and terror combined.
For this was drama, more than enough to
satisfy her. If they didn’t believe her—why, then
they must think her either crazy or an awful liar and
a thief! What did they do with crazy people—and
with thieves? The Judge had a court and a
jail—Neil had said so. And she had laughed, only
a little while ago, at the mere idea of her being
sent to jail, as Neil had said, to tease her. It was
no laughing matter now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” choked Jacqueline. “I
want my Aunt Edie—she’ll know I’m me. And my
Uncle Jimmie! Oh, oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha was herself again. Nothing apparently
could down her, except the dreadful fear that
one of her children could be a thief and a liar. She
drew Jacqueline down on her lap, and held her
safe against her breast, and Jacqueline, for all she
was eleven next month and so big she nearly overwhelmed
Aunt Martha, clung tight to her and wept
into the hollow of her sunburnt neck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, there, you poor child!” soothed Aunt
Martha. “Cry all you want to—cry it out!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t <i>want</i> to!” sniffled Jacqueline, and lifted
her smeary face. “Lend me your hanky, Aunt Martha.
Nellie’s got mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She dried her eyes and felt a little better, but she
didn’t offer to leave Aunt Martha’s lap, and she was
thankful that Aunt Martha still kept hold of her,
for the Judge was right there in the big rocker, and
his steely eyes, under his drawn brows never wavered
from her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well! Well!” said the Judge. “So you’re Jacqueline,
are you, and not Caroline Tait at all?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Judge!” Aunt Martha begged. “Don’t
get her all upset again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I’m <i>not</i> sick,” insisted Jacqueline, “and I
won’t get upset unless you go calling me crazy like
they did in the book.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What book?” the Judge questioned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The silly old ‘Prince and the Pauper,’” Jacqueline
explained. “Judge Blair gave it to me to
read on the train, but I never want to see it again as
long as I live, because it was the book that did it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Judge leaned back in his chair, and fitted his
finger tips together. Over them he watched Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go ahead,” he bade, “and tell us all about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Caroline got on the train at Chicago,”
Jacqueline told her story in the intense silence,
“and she was scared to death about going to the
farm, because of the boys and the cows, and no
piano—and I didn’t want to go to Great-aunt Eunice’s
poky old house—and the two boys in the
book changed round—and Caroline and I were both
going on eleven, and had brown hair, and nobody
in Longmeadow had ever seen either of us—and I
thought it would be fun——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her voice began to falter, as she sensed the gravity
of both her listeners. What she and Caroline
had done, she realized now, was dangerous and
dreadful. She dropped her eyes, thoroughly
ashamed, but though she could not keep the quaver
out of her voice, she spoke the words that it was
only fair to speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was mostly me,” she confessed. “Caroline
wouldn’t have done it, not even for the piano, but
I said she was a quitter, and we changed clothes
and things, only she kept Mildred, and when she got
off the train at Baring Junction, the Gildersleeves
just grabbed her—and I went in the Lizzie with
Aunt Martha.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I—never!” gasped Aunt Martha. She
was amazed, she was a little angry, perhaps. But
she wasn’t crying the way she cried when Jacqueline
said she had taken the beads. “Did you mean to
keep it up all summer, Jackie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Aunt Martha,” Jacqueline admitted. “The
day I broke the cups, you know, when I went up to
the village I was going to change back, but Caroline
was having a party next day—they thought
she was Jacqueline, you know—and she cried. She’d
never had a party nor nothing. So I told her we’d
let things go till Aunt Edie came in September, and
I wouldn’t have given the show away now, only I
couldn’t stand it, Aunt Martha, to have you think—what
you thought about me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Deplorably Aunt Martha hugged Jacqueline at
this point, instead of shaking her, as really Jacqueline
deserved to be shaken.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There now, Judge!” Aunt Martha cried exultantly.
“It’s all true, that part about her running
off to the village, the day the cups were broken.”
The Judge shook his grizzled head, above his
finger tips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That may be true, Martha, but you’ll admit the
rest of the story sounds pretty queer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t care how queer and far-fetched it
sounds,” insisted Aunt Martha. “I’d believe <i>any</i>
story before I’d believe this child isn’t honest. Why,
Judge, whoever she is, she’s been round here with
me, going on nine weeks now. I tell you, she
<i>couldn’t</i> steal nor lie. ’Tisn’t in her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Judge looked down a moment at his finger
tips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Remember what day it was she got here, Martha?”
he asked unexpectedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Judge. The twenty-third of June. Her
mother’s cousin wrote me the day and train I was
to expect her, and ’twas the same day I had a bill
to pay in Baring.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hm!” said the Judge. “Yes, that was the day
that Mrs. Gildersleeve’s little grandniece arrived
from California. I remember because Mrs. Gildersleeve
declined an invitation to dine with us that
night—on my birthday. She’d counted a lot on seeing
that child. The two girls came on the same train
from Chicago, that much is sure. And you’d never
seen this little niece of yours?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Judge, I wouldn’t have known her from a hole
in the ground.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you ever notice anything in her behavior different
from what you would naturally have expected
in your brother’s child? I know you want
to believe her story, Martha, but I trust you to be
careful and exact.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, there <i>were</i> some queer things, now I come
to think of it,” Aunt Martha spoke eagerly, with her
arms still round Jacqueline. “Why, Judge, this
child didn’t know the look of her own trunk, nor
where to find her trunk-key. I thought ’twas just
because she was upset with the journey, but I see
now how it came about. She had a pocketful of
real expensive candy—she said it was given her by a
little girl on the train.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I said a little girl on the train had a boxful,”
murmured Jacqueline. “And the little girl was me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And she hadn’t one single idea about the value
of money,” Aunt Martha went on joyfully. “I
thought ’twas just because they’d brought her up
foolishly, but of course the Gildersleeves don’t have
to count their pennies. Then she didn’t know how
to do one blessed thing about the house, but she
took hold nicely, and she’s been a real help to me
all summer. Why, Judge,” Aunt Martha cried in
sudden dismay, “if she’s Jacqueline Gildersleeve,
she’ll be leaving us, and I don’t know how I’ll ever
get along without her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline hadn’t thought of that, when she
planned her merry trick, there on the train. She
was going to hurt Aunt Martha—Aunt Martha,
who believed in her and stood up for her to the
Judge. She began to sniffle, not for temper this
time, and buried her face in Aunt Martha’s coarse,
clean handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t think—’twould be like this,” she sobbed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, well!” crooned the Judge. “It doesn’t
sound very probable, but I must admit it’s not impossible—no,
not altogether impossible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline lifted her face from the pocket handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Caroline will tell you it’s so, when she gets back
from the beach,” she hiccoughed, “and Aunt Edie
and Uncle Jimmie, when they come in September.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, of course,” cried Aunt Martha eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hm!” boomed the Judge like a bee, but not a
benevolent one. “But what shall we do until they
come? This little girl is in a pretty awkward fix,
because of these beads, if she can’t prove to us that
she’s Jacqueline Gildersleeve.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Send for the other child,” bristled Aunt
Martha, “the <i>real</i> Caroline. Guess I’ve got some say in
the matter, if she’s my honest-to-goodness niece.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Judge shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>This</i> one is your niece,” he said, with finality,
“until there’s proof to the contrary, and I won’t
send for the other child and have Eunice Gildersleeve
upset for what may be a cock-and-bull story.
Let’s see!” he mused. “Uncle Jimmie and Aunt
Edie are our next hope. Where can we reach these
relatives of yours?” He turned to Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know where they are now,” Jacqueline
confessed mournfully. “All their letters have gone
to Caroline, of course, and they’re moving about all
the time, and changing their address.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said the Judge, “you must think up somebody
else who can identify you, and some way of
making the identification by telegraph. A mere description
isn’t enough. There must be some distinguishing
feature. You haven’t a strawberry
mark on your left arm, have you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline laughed hysterically, and at sight of
what her parted lips disclosed, Aunt Martha gave
a cry of triumph.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Those braces, Judge,” she cried. “The braces
on her teeth! There just couldn’t be two children
with the identical same dental work. In fact, I
don’t believe my real niece has any such.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Judge looked at Aunt Martha with genuine
approval.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You always did have a good head on your
shoulders, Martha,” he said. “Dental work, eh? Come
to think of it, I know myself that the little girl at
The Chimnies has had no dentistry done in several
years. I rode into Boston one day with Penelope,
when she was taking the child to the dentist, and
she commented quite sharply on the way in which
her teeth had been neglected. So now if this little
girl will give us the address of her dentist——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s Dr. Graydon on the tenth floor of the Wouverman
Building in Los Angeles,” Jacqueline answered
readily. “Most all the girls I know go to
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Judge wrote down the address methodically,
in a little black note-book.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll wire him at once,” he said, more to Aunt
Martha than to Jacqueline. “I shall have to retain
these beads, as a matter of form, until the child’s
story is proved or disproved. Meantime it will help
to settle this affair if she returns the five dollars she
got from the little Trowbridge girl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, dear! Here were more storm clouds gathering,
just as the sky seemed about to clear!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t return the money,” Jacqueline faltered.
“I—I spent it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Judge looked grave again, but his voice was
patient, and Aunt Martha was encouraging, so Jacqueline
managed to give a full account of the act
that she now was so ashamed of—the taking of Caroline’s
precious old beads, and the pledging them
with Miss Crevey.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Jacqueline had finished Aunt Martha
started eagerly to confirm her story about bringing
home a green-dragon cup, several weeks before,
but the Judge cut her short.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get the lacquer box and show us the beads,” he
bade.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline slipped from Aunt Martha’s lap to
obey, and as she left the room heard the Judge asking
where the telephone was.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Jacqueline came down with the box that
held the beads, she found the Judge at the wall phone
in the kitchen, and Aunt Martha by the table trying
hard not to listen, but with her ears pricked up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Crevey,” her lips shaped the words for
Jacqueline’s comfort. She seemed to guess that
Jacqueline might uneasily be thinking of the town
constable.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Judge turned from the telephone at last, with
a flicker of a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” he nodded to Aunt Martha, “Lucretia
Crevey was a most unwilling witness, but she did
at last confirm as much of the child’s story as pertains
to her. And so these are the beads that made
the trouble, eh?” He looked at the yellow coil
that Jacqueline showed him in the lacquer box which
she uncovered. “It might have been very serious
trouble for you, little what’s-your-name,” he went
on gravely. “You realize that, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline nodded, and drew a little nearer to
Aunt Martha, who put her arm quickly round her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Other articles, besides the string of beads you
call your own, are missing from The Chimnies,” the
Judge went on, “and you, having taken the beads
and disposed of them to the child next door, were
naturally suspected of taking them all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline pressed closer to Aunt Martha’s side.
She hadn’t breath enough now even to say “Oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was by the merest chance,” the Judge rubbed
it in, “that it wasn’t the town constable who came
here after you, instead of me, but luckily some
ladies, who know Mrs. Conway here and wanted to
spare her as much trouble as possible, heard about
the beads, and put the case up to me. That’s why
I came to call this morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t ever thank you enough, Judge,” Aunt
Martha said, with a wavering sort of smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>They followed the Judge out into the sunshine of
the side-yard, where the children still were grouped
under the shade of the trees where Jacqueline had
left them such ages ago, as it seemed to her, when
she thought of all that had happened since that
moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You understand, Martha,” the Judge said, as
he settled himself in his roadster, “the little girl
is still technically under suspicion. I’ll suspend
judgment about this hocus-pocus, switched identity
business, till I hear from that Los Angeles dentist.
Meantime she’s remanded to your custody, and I’ll
trust you to produce her at my office, if she should
be needed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My, but that sounded as formal and dreadful as
the clatter of prison bolts! Jacqueline shivered, in
spite of the heat, and she was glad when she saw the
Judge’s car disappear in the white, powdery dust
of the highway.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Jacqueline turned to Aunt Martha.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh,” she said and once more with weariness and
excitement and remorse, she was half-crying. “I
sure have got in awful wrong. I never thought, when
I started things, there on the train! And now I’ve
made you heaps and heaps of trouble, Aunt Martha—and
you believed me—and stood up for me
like all kinds of a brick—and you’re not my Aunt
Martha, either, and oh! I’m sorry that you
aren’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha put her arm round Jacqueline’s
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re a naughty child, Jackie,” she said tremulously,
“to go and play such tricks on all of us—a
very naughty child. Your folks will probably
punish you.” She hugged Jacqueline close. “But <i>I</i>
don’t have to, because you’re not <i>my</i> niece—but oh,
dear me! don’t I just wish you were!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXXVIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br /> <br />ALL ON A SUMMER AFTERNOON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Graydon in Los Angeles sent Judge
Holden a telegram, brimful of dental technicalities,
that convinced the Judge (Aunt Martha
needed no convincing!) that it was indeed Jacqueline
Gildersleeve who had posed all summer as
Caroline Tait. So Jacqueline, secure in the thought
that two people in Longmeadow knew that she was
the little girl she claimed to be, waited at the
Conway farm for the coming of Aunt Edith and
Uncle Jimmie, who should set her entirely right in
the eyes of all the rest of the whispering village.
You can easily believe that she was now counting
the days until the day, some time in September, when
they should come.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline, too, at Monk’s Bay was counting the
days, only where Jacqueline told herself joyously:
“One day nearer!” Caroline was sighing:	“One
day less!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry when
Cousin Penelope, in her sudden fashion, told her one
afternoon that they were going back to Longmeadow
day after to-morrow. Caroline hated to leave the
downs, where she had had such walks and shy talks
with Cousin Penelope, and the white beach, and the
ocean that made music like cathedral organs. But
it would be blissful to have a few days more at The
Chimnies, to sit with Mildred and Aunt Eunice in
the summer house, and play for Cousin Penelope on
the singing piano, and sleep in her own lovely room—no,
Jacqueline’s room!—before she went away
into the Meadows forever.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the long ride home—no, it wasn’t home to
her, as it was to Cousin Penelope and Aunt Eunice!—Caroline
sat silent in her corner of the cushioned
limousine. She held Mildred in her arms and was
sorry for her. Mildred was going to miss the
limousine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Much of the time they drove along country roads,
and in the pastures on either side there were cattle
grazing, black and white Holstein cows, and Jersey
cows, and cows that were just plain old red mooley.
When Caroline looked at them, for all that they
were only mildly feeding, she held Mildred tighter,
and wished that she dared to whisper her not to be
afraid, for maybe the cows at half-aunt Martha’s
farm were kind cows.</p>

<p class='c009'>And maybe the Conway cousins weren’t like the
fearsome boys they passed on the road: middle-sized
boys with air rifles and fishing rods, intent on
killing harmless things; big boys, clattering in
home-made automobiles; little boys banging on
drums and blowing tin trumpets with a racket that
split the ears. Oh, boys were terrible beings, noisy,
and full of mischief and strange cruelties! Some
boys, just for the fun of it, liked to break and rend
a little girl’s dolls. Caroline held Mildred very
close and almost fancied she could feel her tremble.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there’ll be lots of days yet,” Caroline told
herself eagerly. “There’ll be ten days at least—maybe
twelve—before I have to go to the
Meadows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the middle of the afternoon when they
rolled at last, almost as noiseless as a shadow, down
the sunlight-checkered street of Longmeadow, and
turned in at the iron gate of The Chimnies. How
lovely the garden looked, with its rows of gladioli,
like lances in rest, its tall sentinel hollyhocks, its
masses of gillyflowers, and of bouncing zinnias!
The pears were ripening on the trees, and a purple
blush was on the plums. Caroline’s tongue unloosed
itself, and she was talking fast as she pattered up
the porch steps at Aunt Eunice’s side, but Cousin
Penelope was moodily silent as she had been, Caroline
now remembered, all through the long journey.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sallie met them, beaming, at the door, and spoke
at once of the tea that Hannah had all ready for
them. Just a hasty freshening the travelers permitted
themselves—time enough for Caroline to
make sure that her green and golden room was as
perfect as it was the day she left it—and then they
were seated round the tea table by the open window
in the long parlor that looked upon the garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice poured the tea carefully into the
shallow, fragile old china cups, and Sallie fetched
in the mahogany curate’s assistant, with a plate of
fresh cinnamon toast, a plate of olive and cheese
sandwiches, and a plate of small, rich, chocolate
cakes with a frosting thick with nut-meats—cakes
such as Hannah alone could make.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is like old times,” Aunt Eunice sighed with
content. “The old china, and the old silver!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked fondly at the thin, old-fashioned
spoon that she held.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mis’ Gildersleeve,” Sallie broke out, contrary
to all decorum, but doesn’t a home-coming
justify a breaking of rules? “Such a scare as we
had over them spoons!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope lifted her eyebrows never so
slightly. She really was most unsocial to-day! But
Aunt Eunice was all friendly interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Sallie,” she said, “don’t tell me you mislaid
one of these spoons!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, worse than that!” Sallie explained with
relish. “I went and mislaid the whole kit an’ bilin’
of ’em. Mis’ Gildersleeve, I’d taken my Bible-oath
I put ’em under the dinner napkins in the back of
the side-board drawer, but if you’ll believe me, I
went to get ’em, and I couldn’t find hide nor hair of
’em. You could have knocked me down with a
feather.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you found them, didn’t you?” asked Aunt
Eunice, a little anxiously, even though she held one
of the precious spoons in her hand that very minute.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I couldn’t have looked you in the face otherwise,”
Sallie assured her. “I ran right over an’ told
Mis’ Trowbridge, an’ she told Mis’ Holden, an’
she told the Judge—and oh! Mis’ Gildersleeve, he
wants to call on you, soon’s you get back—most
particular.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sallie bridled as she said the words, and looked
mysterious. Why shouldn’t she? Didn’t she know—or
think she knew!—the whole story of Jacqueline’s
gold beads, which she was not to mention to
Aunt Eunice?</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what about the spoons?” cried Aunt Eunice,
not in the least surprised that her old friend, the
Judge, should wish to bid her a prompt welcome
home.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, if you’ll believe me,” Sallie gave a
sheepish giggle. “I found ’em that self-same night,
tucked away under the best towels in the linen
closet, where I’d hid ’em for better safety. I knew
I’d tucked them under something—somewheres!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, well,” said Aunt Eunice, much relieved.
“It’s fortunate, Sallie, that the Judge hadn’t called
in the constable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, but there’s more to it than that,” Sallie went
on mysteriously. “There’s a lot of things gone from
this room and never been found yet. I wouldn’t
have called it to your mind, like the Judge told me
not to, only you’re bound to miss ’em. The silver
things are gone from the desk, an’ the old snuff-box,
an’——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t worry, Mother,” Cousin Penelope spoke,
in the cool, aloof voice that no one knew better how
to use. “I put a lot of knick-knacks away for safe
keeping in that deep drawer in the hall closet. It
was the morning we left, when the car was at the
door. And Sallie never discovered they were missing,
until the house was re-opened.” Cousin Penelope
smiled wintrily. “Really, Sallie, you must have
done the parlor very hastily on the morning when
we left for the beach.”</p>

<p class='c009'>What a way Cousin Penelope had of catching you
in your own avowals and putting you in the wrong!
And if she could look like judgment seats, just because
poor Sallie had hurried her work on the day
when she, too, was going on a vacation, what would
she look like, when she found out, as so soon she
must find out, that Caroline was really a little impostor?
At the mere thought Caroline put down
her strip of crumbly toast untasted.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was glad that the knocker at the front door
went clang that very minute—glad for Sallie, who
could cover her flushed embarrassment by hurrying
to the door—glad for herself, because her sudden
loss of appetite went unnoticed in the excitement
that the prospect of a visitor seemed most surprisingly
to create.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh,” cried Aunt Eunice, in genuine agitation.
“It can’t possibly be—so soon!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Probably it’s Judge Holden,” Cousin Penelope
spoke calmly. “A most unseasonable time to call.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re not coming in!” said Aunt Eunice, with
marked relief. She actually had turned in her
chair, and sat with her anxious face toward the
wide doorway that led into the hall. “It was
foolish of me to be startled—of course it couldn’t
be——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps it’s Jackie!” Caroline’s heart beat fast,
and a little guiltily, as she said the words to herself.
“Perhaps she’s come to ask me to change—right
now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She didn’t dare follow the thought to its conclusion.
To lose the precious, hoarded days that she
was counting, as a miser counts his treasure—oh,
how could she bear it!</p>

<p class='c009'>The outside door closed with unnecessary noise.
After all, Sallie was human and must vent her feelings
somehow! Cousin Penelope frowned. Was it
with mere annoyance—or anxiety? For Sallie had
come back into the room, and in her hand she carried
a special delivery letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s for you, Miss Penelope,” she said, rather
grumpily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait a minute!” bade Cousin Penelope. She
tore the bestamped envelope clumsily—and to be
clumsy and in haste was not like Cousin Penelope.
She gave one glance at the sheet that lay within.
“We’ll not dine to-night until seven o’clock, tell
Hannah,” she said, without lifting her eyes. “And
you can lay two more places at table.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She tore the letter into four pieces, with a quick,
angered movement, as if she would have liked to
tear something that could feel.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sallie went out of the room. Caroline watched
her go, in a kind of daze. She didn’t want to look
at Aunt Eunice or Cousin Penelope. She didn’t
want to ask questions. She almost knew what was
coming.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought it better not to tell you, Jacqueline,”
said Cousin Penelope, in a voice of hard misery.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There might have been some change of plans,”
Aunt Eunice interrupted, gently and rather wearily.
“We didn’t want you to be—disappointed. Of
course you have looked forward to their coming.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline looked from Aunt Eunice’s distressed
old face to Cousin Penelope’s averted, angry face.
She knew that one was as sorry as the other. And
she herself—where had her voice gone to? Was
it like this when people died?</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose,” she managed to whisper, after what
seemed ages of heart-broken silence, “you mean—that
they——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your uncle and aunt,” Cousin Penelope spoke in
a crisp voice, “are motoring up from Connecticut.
They’ve just written that they’ll be with us—late
this afternoon.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXXIX' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXXIX<br /> <br />THE END OF A JOURNEY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Aunt Eunice said she would lie down for a
bit before dinner. Really she felt the need
of rest after the long ride from Monk’s Bay.
Cousin Penelope approved, but said that she would
go herself to call on Madame Woleski. Would
Jacqueline come with her?</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline shook her head. Please, she would like
to rest, too, before dinner. She was tired out. And
that last was no fib. She seemed to herself to be
tired clear through to her very soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up in the airy green and gold chamber that was
Jacqueline’s, Caroline sat down in the low rocker,
and wondered why the tears didn’t come. Tears
would have brought relief but she couldn’t wait for
them. She had no time to waste, for she was going
to be out of that house before Cousin Penelope came
back. No doubt she was a coward and a quitter,
just as Jackie had called her, for she couldn’t—she
simply couldn’t—face the awful, unknown uncle and
aunt that didn’t belong to her, and even less could
she face the amazement in Aunt Eunice’s kind eyes,
and the anger in Cousin Penelope’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course, though, she must leave a word, so
that they need not worry when they found her gone.
She sat down at the pretty desk with the brass fittings
that she had so longed to use, and for the first
and only time she wrote a letter on the creamy thick
paper with “The Chimnies, Longmeadow, Massachusetts”
engraved upon it. This was the letter:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Dear Mrs. Gildersleeve</span>:</p>

<p class='c005'>I can’t say Aunt Eunice because you are not my
aunt, and I am very sorry. And I have not hurt
Jackie’s things, only holes in some of the sox and
the clasp of the gold beads is broken. I am sorry
about the dentist’s bill and the music lessons. I
should not have let you but there are cows at the
farm and so many babies at Cousin Delia’s. I am
taking Mildred’s clothes you made because Jackie
doesn’t like dolls and maybe they wouldn’t fit hers
anyway and the satin box she gave me herself. I
will send back Jackie’s clothes I have on and I am
sorry.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c011'  >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Affectionately yours,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Caroline Tait</span>, which is my name.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Please tell Miss Penelope how sorry I am when
she was so good to me and you were so good, and
give my kindest regards to Sallie and Hannah.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was crying a little now. How funny the
round tears looked where they spattered on the
creamy paper! She blotted the sheet hastily and
slipped it into an envelope. In story books, when
people left home, they always pinned their farewell
notes to the pin-cushion, but that seemed to Caroline
a foolish thing to do. How should Aunt Eunice
see a little note on the pin-cushion, if she looked in
at the door? And Aunt Eunice must see it at once,
or she might be worried when there was no little
girl in the house at dinner time.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a moment’s thought Caroline softly tipped
the rocker forward ignominiously upon the floor.
She placed a pillow from the bed upon the rocker,
and pinned her note, addressed to “Mrs. Gildersleeve,”
upon the pillow. Certainly Aunt Eunice
or Cousin Penelope or whoever came first into the
room would be sufficiently struck with the oddity of
its arrangement to look further and find the note.
Then she put on her hat (Jacqueline’s hat, but the
plainest she could find!) and she took Mildred
under one arm, and the satin box, full of little doll-clothes,
under the other arm, and softly, on tiptoe,
not daring to look back, she stole out of the darling
room, and closed the door upon it.</p>

<p class='c009'>If she happened to meet Sallie, she meant to tell
her she was going to look for Eleanor Trowbridge.
But she didn’t meet Sallie. Unchallenged, she
slipped out at the front door and across the fragrant
garden, where she was never to play again.
Through the gap in the hedge she reached the shortcut,
and a moment later she was in Longmeadow
Street, and heading south toward the road that she
knew led into the Meadows.</p>

<p class='c009'>A smart sedan came rolling toward her up the
wide, shaded street. As it met her and passed by,
she was aware of people who nodded to her
pleasantly. That was Mrs. Francis Holden, the Judge’s
daughter-in-law, and Doris and Edith Holden, her
two little girls with whom Caroline had played sometimes.
They were bowing and smiling to Jacqueline
Gildersleeve, in a kilted pongee skirt and an orange
silk slip-over. They weren’t bowing to Caroline
Tait, in borrowed clothes. They would never know
Caroline Tait.</p>

<p class='c009'>For down in the Meadows, surely Caroline would
be in a different school district, and as for Sunday
School—she was never coming to Longmeadow
again, not even for Sunday School—not even if she
died a heathen! She would do anything half-aunt
Martha asked her to do—why, she believed she
would even milk the cows!—if only half-aunt
Martha wouldn’t make her go into Longmeadow
for anything. She simply couldn’t face the village
and the people who had known her as Jacqueline,
now that they must know her as a cheat. She would
be too ashamed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The shaded, wide street, with its picturesque old
houses set in their colorful, scented gardens, opened
in a little patch of sun and dust, where the treeless
road to the Meadows branched off. Here Caroline
turned her back on Longmeadow, and trudged
heavily along the way that was marked out for her.
The sun was sinking toward the western hills, but
the air was hot and breathless, and the smell of the
onion fields caught her by the throat and almost
choked her. Now and then an automobile overtook
and passed her—ramshackle cars, mostly, and in
them swarthy men, who spoke a strange tongue.
Once one of them called to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was only friendly Mr. Zabriski, in his kindness
offering a ride to a strange, white-faced child, who
looked too tired to walk, but to Caroline he seemed
a dangerous character. She clutched Mildred and
the box of clothes, and scuttled off among the
onions, and Mr. Zabriski, justly offended, grunted
his indignation and clattered on.</p>

<p class='c009'>The powdery white dust hung in a cloud above
the road after he had passed. Caroline breathed
it, ate it. There was dust in her hair—dust in her
shoes. She wondered if she could keep on setting
one foot before the other until she reached her destination.
How far was it to the Conway farm in
the Meadows? Jackie had walked the distance
and made light of it. But Jackie was afraid of
nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the first house she came to on the sparsely
settled road she saw a big dog, so she did not dare
to stop and ask questions. At the second house, a
long way farther on, were swarthy children, who
shouted at her in their strange tongue, and in terror
for Mildred she almost ran past the place without
stopping. By the time she reached the third house,
her mouth and throat were lined with dust and she
was ready to cry with weariness and despair. She
would have asked any one for directions now, even a
Polish farm-hand or a jeering child. But when she
reached the tumble-down gray house, she found it
tenantless.</p>

<p class='c009'>She sat for a little while on the doorstep and
rested. The sun was sinking fast. More cars
rattled by in the dust, as men went home
from the fields. Soon it would be dinner time at The
Chimnies. She must find Jackie quickly. In a panic
she realized that her letter of explanation really
hadn’t explained things. Jackie was needed to set
matters right and ease Aunt Eunice’s mind. She
got to her aching feet and plodded stiffly on through
the powdery dust.</p>

<p class='c009'>She thought that she would never reach the
fourth house. It seemed always to recede, as she
drew near it on her weary feet. It was a square
house under some elms. It needed paint badly.
There were lilac bushes by the sagging front door.
In the side-yard an old hammock swung between two
trees. In the trodden dirt beside the hammock two
little children were playing—a girl at the toddling
age, and a boy in overalls, who was a couple of
years older. With joy she saw that they weren’t
foreign children. Hopefully she went up to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello!” said the little boy, with a smeared and
friendly smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello!” said Caroline. “Who lives here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do,” said the boy. He went on digging up dirt
with an iron spoon and putting it into an old baking
dish.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s your name?” Caroline pursued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Freddie,” he told her. “She’s Annie. She’s my
sister.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what’s your other name?” begged Caroline.
“What’s your mother’s name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My mother’s dead,” Freddie told her nonchalantly.
“Aunt Marfa’s my mother now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha! Then her search was over. This
was the farm, and here were two of her cousins, and
the cows were somewhere, ambushed, perhaps, in
the big barn that was filling fast with shadows.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where you going?” Freddie looked up to question
in his turn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nowhere,” Caroline told him, over a great lump
in her dusty throat. Indeed there was no going
farther. Least of all was it possible to turn back.</p>

<p class='c009'>She left the children, and with dragging steps she
walked across the side-yard to what must be the
kitchen door of the farm-house. She stopped on the
doorstep and looked through the screen door into
an old-fashioned, low-ceiled kitchen. Pretty soon
the room would be as familiar to her as Cousin
Delia’s kitchen, with its faded linoleum and mud-colored
wood-work. But now she found it strange,
and rather terrible in its strangeness. If she didn’t
knock quickly, she would lose courage and run away
and hide—and there was no place to run to! She
knocked quickly and loudly on the frame of the
screen door.</p>

<p class='c009'>In another moment a squarely-built woman, with
a bibbed apron over her dark dress, came hurrying
out from an inner room. She had keen gray eyes
that in one second seemed to have taken in the whole
of Caroline, from her dusty sandals (Jacqueline’s
sandals!) to her brown leghorn hat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bobbed brown hair and going on eleven,” the
woman murmured, and then she threw the screen
door wide open. “I guess I know who you are, this
time,” she said, with a dry chuckle. “Come right
in here, Caroline Tait.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXL' class='c010'>CHAPTER XL<br /> <br />TURN ABOUT AGAIN!</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Jacqueline wasn’t at the Conway farm,
when Caroline, in frantic quest of her, came
stumbling into the kitchen, on Aunt Martha’s invitation.
Instead she was down on the knoll by the
river having a picnic with the young Conways.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a most unusually nice picnic. Dickie had
gone early to the knoll, and with his Boy Scout lore
had built a fire and set potatoes to roast in the hot
embers. Some of them were a little underdone at
supper time, and some were a little overdone, but
smeared with butter, they tasted ever so much better
than the baked potatoes that one ate off a plate at
home in the dining room. Besides the potatoes there
were apple turnovers, made with flaky pie crust,
as a special treat. Aunt Martha had time to do
some of the cooking herself, now that Grandma was
able to sit up.</p>

<p class='c009'>The picnickers left nothing for the birds but a
very few crumbs, and they straggled home through
the onion fields, just before sunset, fed-up and contented,
so that even the thought of the good-night
chores couldn’t damp their happiness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll stir up a batch of Graham bread and set it
to rise,” Jacqueline murmured, “but first I’ll give
Annie and Freddie their baths. And you’ve got to
take a bath, too—you hear me, Nellie? Not just
your feet and a lick at your neck, but all over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did yesterday,” protested Nellie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will to-day,” said Jacqueline in her bossiest
voice, “or else you won’t sleep in the bed with me,
and don’t you forget it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Quite as important as the mother of a large
family, Jacqueline bustled into the kitchen, which
was now growing dusky. Soft splashings from the
washroom and gurgles from Freddie told her that
Aunt Martha had forestalled her at part of her
labors. She must already have bathed and bedded
Annie, and now she was at work on Freddie.</p>

<p class='c009'>Honestly Jacqueline was sorry to seem to have
shirked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, come now, Aunt Martha!” she spoke into
the washroom. “You didn’t need to do that. You
knew I was coming.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha looked up from where she knelt in
the lamp light to scrub Freddie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Tisn’t likely you’ll have time for any chores to-night,”
she explained. “Your folks’ll be sending for
you any minute now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” said Jacqueline, with a squeak like the
squeak of a rubber pig when you let the air out of it.
“You mean—but they can’t be! They haven’t got
back from the beach—not yet!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everything’s happened all in a heap,” Aunt
Martha told her. “They’ve come back from the
beach, sure enough, to meet your aunt and uncle.
They must be here by this time. Caroline turned
up ’bout five o’clock with the news.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Caroline is here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. She looked pretty well done out, poor
young one. I just took time to call up the Judge
and ask him to step right over to your Aunt Eunice’s,
and tell her the whole story and how both you
children were here at the farm, waiting for them
to send and get the one that really belongs to them.
Then I packed Caroline off to bed. She’s in your
old room. Better kite upstairs and speak to her.
You may not have much time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That was all Aunt Martha said. Matter of fact
like that, and scrubbing Freddie’s neck while she
talked, so vigorously that he began to whine!
Jacqueline herself had no choice but to take matters
calmly, though she felt this to be a most exciting
hour of her life. What would she say, that horrid
old Cousin Penelope, when she found the little girl
she had snubbed was really her cousin’s child?
Jacqueline chuckled a little to herself, as she
scampered up the narrow stairs to the north chamber.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the big bed in the corner Caroline rose on one
elbow and looked at her—a white-faced Caroline
with dark smudges under her eyes. She was wearing
one of the scant, thin little gowns that Jacqueline
had worn all summer, and she held Mildred
in her tiny be-trimmed nightdress, close against her
breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello, Carol!” said Jacqueline. But her voice
didn’t sound so jaunty as she meant it to.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Jackie!” Caroline cried at sight of her.
“Did Aunt Martha tell you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure,” answered Jacqueline, and sat down in her
dusty Peggy Janes, upon the edge of the bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s awful good,” said Caroline, in a wavering
voice. “She said not to worry about the cows—the
boys look after them. And she wanted me to eat
some supper but I couldn’t. She didn’t scold, not
one bit. Oh, Jackie, I’m afraid Cousin Penelope
will scold you—dreadfully.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should worry,” said Jacqueline.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline looked at her for a moment with all the
old admiration, and then she shook her head woefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We shouldn’t have done it, Jackie—it was an
awful thing to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Jacqueline defensively, “you liked
the piano, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Y-yes,” Caroline confessed, and then the tears
began to drip down her cheeks, and she hid her head
in the pillow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, suffering chipmunks!” Jacqueline cried
angrily. “Don’t do that! Don’t do that, I tell you!
Would you rather we hadn’t?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I-I don’t know!” wept Caroline. “No, I guess
not. Yes, I guess so—perhaps.” She dried her
eyes uncertainly with the front of her wrist. “There
are your clothes, Jackie,” she said in a voice that
she tried vainly to keep steady. “All folded up on
the chair. I put them on fresh this morning—down
at Monk’s Bay—in the beautiful Shieling.” She bit
her lip that trembled, and went on: “Don’t you
believe—you could wear them back?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline gave her a startled look.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I want to wear the Peggy Janes,” she said,
“and knock ’em dead with surprise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Couldn’t she just see herself “making an entrance”
at the Gildersleeves’ poky house—the dismay
of that starched Cousin Penelope—the amazement
of Aunt Edie and Uncle Jimmie?</p>

<p class='c009'>“But they are my Peggy Janes,” said Caroline
wistfully, “and I’ve got to have some clothes to
wear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can have those duds of mine,” said Jacqueline,
with an airy gesture toward the kilted pongee
skirt, the orange silk slip-over, the leghorn hat, the
ruffled underwear. “We’ll swap.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no!” Caroline cried in such a distressful
voice that Jacqueline was amazed. “I don’t want
’em—I don’t want ever to see ’em again—take ’em
away, Jackie, please—please!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, sure,” said Jacqueline, somewhat hurt,
“if you feel it that way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hastily, as she had changed on the train, weeks
before, she shed the Peggy Janes and the sneakers,
and put her dusty self into her own lawful, rather
dusty clothes. While she changed, she let her
tongue run on. Somehow she dreaded to have a
silence fall in the room where Caroline crouched so
white-faced in the big bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You didn’t see my Aunt Edie and my Uncle
Jimmie,” Jacqueline questioned, “did you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said Caroline. “I ran right away when I
heard they were coming. It’s an awful long way
from Longmeadow to the farm.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pretty nice, though, when you get here,” said
Jacqueline, as she wriggled into her own sand-colored
silk socks.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline drew a quivering breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is a bigger room than at Cousin Delia’s,”
she said. “Nellie and I will have it together, Aunt
Martha told me. I haven’t seen Nellie, but the
babies are real cunning. I know I shall love them.
Aunt Martha’s going to make me a winter coat out
of an ulster of hers, and dye it blue. It’s cold here
winters—and there’ll be lots of chances to slide—and
there’s a pond where Ralph will teach me to
skate. Aunt Martha’s awful good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll say she is,” assented Jacqueline, as she thrust
herself into the slip-over. “Crazy elephants! I’ve
gone and grown this summer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She stepped to the wavery looking-glass, and
grinned at her own sunbrowned reflection. From
the mirror her glance traveled to the window close
by—the window that looked out on the road—and
at sight of what was passing on the road, she gave
a whoop that made Caroline sit up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, jumping skeeters! It’s my Uncle Jimmie—and
the Judge! They’ve come—they’ve really
come! I’ve got to go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She caught up the leghorn hat. She was Jacqueline
herself again, just as if the summer masquerade
had never happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>As if it had never happened—and Caroline’s
black-smudged eyes fairly stabbing Jacqueline with
their woefulness!</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline swooped down on the bed, and threw
her arms round Caroline, and kissed her tumultuously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you care!” she said. “Think of the fun
you had—and we’ll have some great times together
yet. I’ll come back to-morrow—and you’ll come
and see me at Aunt Eunice’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline said nothing, but it was only afterward
that Jacqueline remembered that she had been silent.
Jacqueline gave her a last hug—she couldn’t linger,
with Uncle Jimmie at the door—and then she galloped
down the narrow stair into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha was there, and Freddie, in his little
Teddie sleeping suit. Nellie was minding him, and
Nellie’s eyes were round with amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was just going to call you,” said Aunt Martha.
“They won’t come in—they’re in an awful hurry. Say
good-by to Grandma. I’ve sort of prepared her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline went quickly and quietly into the parlor
that still was Grandma’s room. Grandma sat in her
worn old wrapper in the big wooden rocker. An
oil lamp burned on the table beside her and her knitting
rested on her knees. Thank goodness, she
often said, she could at least knit again. She
didn’t have to sit round any longer like a bump on
a log!</p>

<p class='c009'>Grandma turned her head and looked at Jacqueline,
and suddenly Jacqueline felt lumpy in the
throat, and teary round the lashes. It wasn’t funny
at all, what she had done and put Caroline up to
doing. And she wasn’t going to enjoy this hour a
little bit, even if she got a hundred rises out of
stuck-up Cousin Penelope.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you ain’t our Jackie, after all,” said Grandma,
in the trembly voice that was hers since her
illness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline went to Grandma’s side and took the
veined old hands tight in both hers.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m <i>your</i> Jackie,” she said painfully. “Oh,
Grandma, I sure will miss you! I’ll run in to-morrow,
and I’m coming back to visit next summer, if
Aunt Martha’ll let me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Grandma smiled, the saddest sort of smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-morrow’s another day, child—and summer’s
a long ways off. There, now, just you kiss me and
run along to your own folks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline bent and kissed the withered old cheek.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t ye cut up no more crazy didoes,”
Grandma whispered with a queer little chuckle that
might as well have been a sob.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t,” said Jacqueline, stifled.</p>

<p class='c009'>She went out of the room very quickly. If she
had stopped or looked back, she realized that she
might have begun to cry. Oh, fuzzy caterpillars,
what was the use of talking grandly to one’s self
about wheelchairs for Grandma and china dishes?
Some things you couldn’t make up for. Some things
you couldn’t set right.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha didn’t aim to have prolonged leave-takings.
She was out on the doorstep, with Freddie,
beshawled, in her arms, and the children standing
round her with perplexed faces, all of them; even
Ralph. In the roadster sat Judge Holden, and
Colonel Jimmie Knowlton stood by the running
board with his cap in his hand, talking with Aunt
Martha.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline threw herself upon Uncle Jimmie and
kissed him. She wanted to get through with everything
very quickly, and drive away. She kissed
Nellie. She kissed Freddie. She dabbed at Aunt
Martha’s cheek.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” cried Nellie suddenly. “Don’t go, Jackie—don’t
go!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“S’long,” Jacqueline nodded to the boys. “I’m
coming back to-morrow. I’ll say you’ve shown me
one grand time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>They were looking at her with big eyes, as if she
were a stranger. Oh, dumb-paste that skirt and
slip-over! If only she could have kept the Peggy
Janes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jump in!” bade her Uncle Jimmie, in his military
voice, which Jacqueline fancied only when he
joked. She suspected that he was in no mood for
joking now.</p>

<p class='c009'>She scuttled into the wide seat of the roadster beside
Judge Holden, who nodded to her gravely.
Uncle Jimmie folded his long legs into the seat beside
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night, Mrs. Conway, and many thanks,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>The car was turning. In a moment the top would
shut away the sight of them, the dear friendly
people who were not her own, standing there with
surprised, reproachful faces, in the dusk that was
about to swallow them up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-by, Aunt Martha,” Jacqueline called.
“I’ll see you to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The roadster had quite turned now, and was
heading for the road.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jackie! Jackie!” That was Freddie’s voice,
lifted in a howl of anguish. “I want my Jackie—Jackie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Jimmie looked down at Jacqueline beside
him. She could feel his eyes boring through her
and she could feel herself shrinking smaller and
smaller, till a crack would have held her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Uncle Jimmie in the tone, she felt,
in which he sent men to be court-martialed—a tone
that left you flat, crushed under tons of righteous
disapproval. “I’ll say that for a nickel-plated,
triple-riveted Miss Mess-it you’ve broken the world’s
record this trip.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXLI' class='c010'>CHAPTER XLI<br /> <br />NIGHT OF JUDGMENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>They were all seated in the softly lighted parlor
at The Chimnies—Cousin Penelope, stonily
silent, Aunt Eunice, wiping her spectacles over and
over, Aunt Edie, little and gray-eyed, with helpless,
fluttery gestures—when Jacqueline, like a criminal
in custody, walked in at Uncle Jimmie’s side.</p>

<p class='c009'>An entrance all right, and drama, but not the kind
Jacqueline wanted!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Jackie!” cried Aunt Edie, as soon as she
set eyes on her. “You dreadful child! What <i>have</i>
you done now? What <i>will</i> you do next? Come here
and kiss me! I hope you didn’t catch anything in
that queer place. I’m so afraid of typhus in these
gone-to-seed old townships.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Edie was insulting New England, just as
Cousin Penelope had expected her to do, but Cousin
Penelope hadn’t the spirit left to do more than fling
her a disdainful glance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go say how-do-you-do to your Aunt Eunice,”
Aunt Edie bade Jacqueline, “and tell her you’re
sorry. You owe her all sorts of apologies. I
shouldn’t think she’d ask you inside her house, after
the way you’ve behaved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline shrugged her shoulders. One had to
put on indifference, if one didn’t want to bawl. She
went to Great-aunt Eunice, made her little curtsy,
and offered a limp hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, well, Jacqueline,” said Aunt Eunice, being
nice with an effort that did not escape Jacqueline,
“we’re very glad to see you here at last. Now we’d
better have dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jackie, you don’t <i>deserve</i> any dinner,” Aunt Edie
spoke emphatically, and this time Cousin Penelope
shot her a glance of heartiest approval.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t <i>want</i> any dinner, thanks,” said Jacqueline
with her chin up. “I had my supper at Aunt
Martha’s, and it’s a very clean, nice place, and no
typhus at all, and I hope you didn’t bring any germs
and things back with <i>you</i> from your nasty old
Alaska.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now don’t get fresh,” warned Uncle Jimmie.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everybody hated her—everybody in the world—it
was worse than Institutions—and Aunt Martha
was way off in the Meadows! Jacqueline felt the
belittling hot tears well into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then don’t you say things about the farm,” she
flared, “nor about Aunt Martha—she’s a lovely
aunt—and I never had a grandmother before—and
oh, dear! Freddie cried when I left, and maybe he’s
crying for me now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She felt her eyes brim over with tears, which she
brushed angrily away. Aunt Edie made a little
helpless movement, as if she might rise and go to
her, but she met Uncle Jimmie’s eye and sat still.
Aunt Eunice, however, wasn’t any relation to Uncle
Jimmie by marriage or otherwise, and she didn’t
care <i>how</i> he looked at her. She just put her arm
round Jacqueline and drew her close.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, come, dear,” she comforted. “Nobody
meant to speak against Martha Conway. She’s the
salt of the earth, and I don’t doubt but the summer
with her has done you a lot of good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll say it has,” Jacqueline sniffled while she felt
forlornly for a handkerchief. “I can make gingerbread—and
apple-sauce—and cook eggs five different
ways. It was a corking farm—and I’m going
down there to-morrow. I told the boys I would. I
didn’t say half the things I want to say to Carol.
I’m going down there early and stay all day——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there won’t be any time to-morrow,” Aunt
Edie struck in. “Didn’t Uncle Jimmie tell you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve not indulged in much conversation,”
Uncle Jimmie spoke dryly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve got to be in New York to-morrow afternoon,”
explained Aunt Edie. “We’ll have to start
at crack of dawn, but don’t bother about breakfast
for us, Mrs. Gildersleeve. We can get something
at the hotel in the next big town. We have to rush—we’ve
booked passage on the <i>Crespic</i> that sails on
Saturday—and there’s rafts of things to do in New
York. Jim has to see people. He’s going over for
the Government, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She gazed at her Jim proudly. Jacqueline stood
with Aunt Eunice’s arm about her (Aunt Eunice
who, she knew, would rather she were Caroline!)
and felt chilly and out of things.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Am I going, too, Aunt Edie?” she questioned
falteringly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, doodle-bug,” Aunt Edie unbent at last,
in spite of Uncle Jimmie. “We can’t leave you behind—no
knowing what you’d get into next. We’ll
be trotting all over the Continent but we’ll find a
school for you in Switzerland——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A strict one,” said Uncle Jimmie.</p>

<p class='c009'>My, how grouchy he was! But he hadn’t had a
chance yet to wash off the dust of two hundred
miles swift motoring and nobody seemed to think
at all about his comfort.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I don’t <i>want</i> to go away to-morrow,” said
Jacqueline painfully. “I’ve got to see Carol again—I
<i>must</i> see Carol.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid Carol will have to wait,” Aunt Edie
dismissed the subject lightly. “Can we have ten
minutes grace before dinner, Mrs. Gildersleeve?
Jim wants to brush himself, I know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That was all Caroline and her affairs meant to
them, those grown folk who were settling things
for Jacqueline. Aunt Edie rushed Uncle Jimmie off
to the guest room. Cousin Penelope said something
in a cold voice about having dinner served, if it
weren’t entirely spoiled by now. Secretly Jacqueline
hoped it was spoiled, since Cousin Penelope would
have to eat it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice was the only one who understood or
cared. She said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll show you to your room now, Jacqueline.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can find it myself,” said Jacqueline stiffly. “I
was here in your house before. Didn’t that Judge
tell you about the beads—my <i>own</i> beads? But I’d
like to have you show me, just the same, if it isn’t
too much trouble,” she conceded, more graciously.</p>

<p class='c009'>Side by side they went up the stairway just as
Aunt Eunice and Caroline had gone, weeks before.
The door was opened into the bedroom that Jacqueline
remembered. Aunt Eunice fumbled with the
electric button, and the light flooded the pale paper
with its leafy frieze, the French gray furniture, the
oyster white rug—and in the middle of the rug
was the rocking chair on its face, with a pillow laid
upon its rockers, and a note pinned to the pillow.
Jacqueline sprang and seized the note.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s for you, Aunt Eunice,” she cried, “and I bet
anything it’s from Carol. Of course she wouldn’t
go away without a word. Oh, read it, do!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice read the little letter that was
splashed with Caroline’s tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear!” quavered Aunt Eunice, beneath her
breath. “The poor little lamb! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c009'>For one second Aunt Eunice and Jacqueline
looked at each other with eyes of complete understanding.
Then Jacqueline threw her arms about
Aunt Eunice, and burst out crying, as she had not
once cried for her own distress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, oh!” she wailed. “She’ll hate it at the farm—I
know she will. The piano is funny and old and
out of tune—and if you don’t sit on those boys, they
get fresh. And Carol won’t sit on ’em. She’s a
’fraid cat. She wouldn’t have changed round with
me in the first place, if I hadn’t made her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t, don’t, my dear!” Aunt Eunice tried to
soothe in a broken voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But she never had a party,” Jacqueline wept on,
“not till you gave her one. That’s why we didn’t
change back again before. We were going to—I
was so sick of it at the farm—but she had to have
her party—she just cried because she wanted it so—she
said it was heaven here—and the nasty old music
lessons—she <i>liked</i> ’em, can you beat it? I wanted
to go see her to-morrow—she wouldn’t keep these
clothes—but I want her to have some of mine—and
a winter coat—I’ll make her take ’em—hers are
funny and old and mended—and I’ve worn ’em out
dreadfully—and she loves pretty clothes—and she
won’t have any more now ever—nor dentists nor
music—and she was eating out of a shoe box on
the train—and it wasn’t her fault at all—I put
her up to it, there on the train—and now—she’s
the one that has—to have—a horrid time—and
c-cows!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was really dreadful, the way Jacqueline was
crying now that she had let herself go. Cousin Penelope,
coming up the stairs, heard the sobs and
screams and hurried into the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother!” she spoke frowningly. “Really, you
mustn’t make yourself ill—over this child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, the worlds of contempt in Cousin Penelope’s
tone, for all that “this child” was Jack Gildersleeve’s
truly daughter!</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Edie came, too, from the guest room down
the hall, more fluttery than ever, and Uncle Jimmie,
who wasn’t fluttery at all. It was he who took the
situation sternly in hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cut it out now, Jack,” he bade. “Don’t be a
rotten sport.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Obediently Jacqueline took her arms from about
Aunt Eunice. She was frightened into complete
silence, when she saw how pale and faint Aunt
Eunice looked. Of course she would be a sport.
Somehow she must make Uncle Jimmie stop frowning
at her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t mean——” she sniffled. “I’m—awful
sorry, Aunt Eunice. Go on and get your old dinner,
everybody. I’m not hungry, nor anything, and I’m
going right straight off to bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice didn’t even kiss Jacqueline. She
went away with Cousin Penelope, as if she had had
all she could stand for one evening, and she took
Caroline’s letter, clasped tight in her hand. Uncle
Jimmie, at a sign from Aunt Edie, followed them,
but as he went he cast at Jacqueline, struggling with
her tears, a look that was a shade less disgusted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Edie lingered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now don’t you cry any more,” she said kindly
enough, and hugged Jacqueline. “It’s all over, and
you’re sorry, and everybody knows it, and forgives
you, so everything is all right again. We shall have
a ripping trip, and of course your Uncle Jimmie was
joking about the school. You won’t be there all
the time anyway—we’ll take you to places with us—and
you shall buy heaps of pretty things. Now
smile to me, old doodle-bug!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline smiled—at least she supposed she did.
She stretched her lips, and Aunt Edie appeared satisfied,
for she kissed her, and urged her to come have
a bite of dinner, just to please Aunt Eunice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if you’re going to cry again, never mind,
lamb-baba!” she added hastily. “Get your bath
and jump into bed, and I’ll come later to tuck you
up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Aunt Edie was gone, and Jacqueline went
to the bureau, to get herself a nightdress. She
opened the drawers, full of snow-white, hand-made
little undergarments, and many-colored socks, fine
handkerchiefs and hair-ribbons, little bags and
gloves and endless pretties. She shut the drawers
noisily, and went to the closet for a kimono. All
about her she found hanging little frocks, just as she
remembered them, of net and organdie, crêpe and
wool, slip-overs and coats, her precious unused riding
suit.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a second she glowed with the joy of having
her own possessions once more. She cast a satisfied
glance round the pretty room, with its pictures, and
knick-knacks of china, its cozy bed, its shaded lights.
But this was the room in which Carol had lived, all
these weeks, and now Carol was lying in the north
chamber at the farm, where the pictures were old
and ugly, and the wall-paper covered with crazy
rose baskets, upside down. Carol, who so loved
pretty things and gentle ways!</p>

<p class='c009'>All over, and everything all right again? That
was what Aunt Edie thought, did she? Much she
knew about it!</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline’s gaze traveled to the bookshelves in
the corner, where the light from the desk lamp fell
strong. She saw lying on the wide top shelf a fat
volume in a gay jacket that was familiar. She
launched herself upon it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dumb-paste you!” she cried. “I wish I’d
never seen you, you beastly mean old ‘Prince and
Pauper’!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She dashed the book on the floor. She kicked it—yes,
she actually kicked it. Then she ran and
threw herself recklessly down on the beautifully
made bed, and if Carol, in the lonely north chamber,
cried to herself that night, Jacqueline, in the green
and gold room at The Chimnies, was crying just as
hard, and perhaps a little harder.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXLII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XLII<br /> <br />PRIDE AND PENELOPE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Aunt Edie and Uncle Jimmie and Jacqueline
didn’t leave The Chimnies quite at crack of
dawn, but they did really sit down to breakfast at
five minutes after seven.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early as it was, Jacqueline had been up already
for half an hour. She had dressed herself in a
jumper of wood brown jersey, and a frilled blouse
of white silk, with an orange colored tie. She had
put some last things into her suitcase, which would
go in Uncle Jimmie’s car. Her trunk, which Aunt
Edie and Sallie had packed the night before, would
go by express straight to the steamer.</p>

<p class='c009'>When her packing was done, she left her brown
cape coat, with its buttons of pressed leather, and
her little soft motor hat of brown, stitched with
orange, lying on the bed with her precious vanity
bag, and she slipped down the back-stairs into the
kitchen. She had been there once before, you’ll remember.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hannah was mixing batter, and the waffle iron
was steaming on the stove.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you’re the young one that really belongs here,
are you?” boomed Hannah. “Well, I never did,
in all my born days!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She didn’t say what it was she never did, and
Jacqueline thought it tactful not to ask her. She
meant to be very tactful, all the rest of her life!</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then Sallie came out from the dining room,
on her way to get chilled water and unsalted butter
from the ice-chest. At sight of Jacqueline she began
to giggle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say,” cried Sallie, “if <i>you’d</i> been here all summer,
I guess things wouldn’t have gone fast, nor
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacqueline grinned in acknowledgment of the
compliment, but rather sheepishly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to give you back your dime,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, shucks!” cried Sallie, reddening.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Honest, I do,” Jacqueline repeated earnestly.
“I shouldn’t have taken it, just for stepping up to
the store to help you out, but I’ll say I needed the
money something awful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll say you must have!” chuckled Sallie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m keeping the twenty-five cents,” Jacqueline
went on. “My Aunt Edie says she’s going to frame
it, ’cause it’s the first money I ever earned, and
Uncle Jimmie says probably it’ll be the last. But
the dime’s in this envelope for you—and here’s an
envelope for Hannah—and I was ever so much
obliged for the milk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She fairly mumbled the last words, as she put the
two creamy envelopes, marked Sallie and Hannah,
on the table, and then she fled. In each envelope
there was a dollar bill, besides the dime in Sallie’s
envelope. Jacqueline had found two dollars in the
purse in her vanity bag. All that summer Caroline
must have scrupulously left the money untouched.</p>

<p class='c009'>Breakfast at The Chimnies that morning was a
rather hectic meal. Cousin Penelope was very silent.
Once her eyes traveled from Jacqueline to the picture
of Great-aunt Joanna that hung on the wall
behind her. Great-aunt Joanna was the austere
lady in the cap, you will remember, that Cousin
Penelope had said Caroline looked like, when she
believed that Caroline was Jacqueline. Now when
Cousin Penelope looked at Great-aunt Joanna she
positively choked over her soft roll, and had to
leave the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice saw that every one had plenty of
coffee and waffles and scrambled eggs and crisp
bacon. But she scarcely ate at all herself. As for
Aunt Edie, she was worried for fear she had mislaid
her trunk-key, and for fear that Jacqueline had
hopelessly upset everybody, and she was more fluttery
and helpless than ever. But Uncle Jimmie was
calm and good-humored. He had said his say the
night before. Now with him by-gones were by-gones,
and he was friends all round, even with his
troublesome niece-by-marriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the good-bys at last were hurriedly and
briefly said, Jacqueline hopped down the steps of the
porch, holding to Uncle Jimmie’s hand, and
scrambled up in front beside the driver’s seat. Aunt
Edie was established in the tonneau, with rugs and
cushions. She meant to sleep clear to New Haven,
she said. Uncle Jimmie slipped his long legs under
the steering wheel beside Jacqueline and as he put
the car in gear, grinned at her, in his old comradely
fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a radiant little face, under the brown and
orange hat, that Jacqueline showed to Aunt Eunice,
as she waved farewell to The Chimnies and to Longmeadow,
and it was with a little half-smile that
Aunt Eunice, on the broad porch, turned to Cousin
Penelope.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad she’s gone off happy,” said Aunt
Eunice. “She’s a bright little thing, and you must
admit it was plucky of her to stick it out at the farm,
and let the other child have a happy summer here.
Fine of her, too, with every one condemning, to
take the whole blame on herself. That was so like
her father!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see it,” Cousin Penelope spoke in a hard
voice. “She’s not one bit a Gildersleeve. She’s a
bold, forward, underbred child—Delane, every
inch of her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice didn’t retort, as well she might have:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Delanes, to judge by ‘Aunt Edie,’ are fair-haired
and gray-eyed and small, while Jacqueline is
brunette and big-boned, like all the Gildersleeves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Old women are often wise women, so Aunt Eunice
merely said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s a pretty child, and I’m sure we should have
come to like her, but I’m glad,” she added, with a
little catch in her voice, “that she happened to pick
a dress that the other one had never worn here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope shivered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s shockingly chilly on the porch,” she spoke
brusquely. “Let’s go into the house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They crossed the threshold, into the cool, dim
hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How quiet the house is!” Aunt Eunice exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>They looked at each other and quickly averted
their eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is a good deal for people to do, when they
come home after weeks of absence. Aunt Eunice
and Cousin Penelope each had her own affairs to
attend to, in the house and the garden. They
managed to see no more of each other until they
sat down to luncheon, just the two of them, in the
big dining-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I called up Martha Conway this morning,” Aunt
Eunice spoke, in one of the many pauses that fell
between them. A little flush—was it shame or defiance?—was
in her withered cheeks. “I wanted to
know how the little girl was, after her long walk,
and all the excitement.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Penelope’s eyes traveled to the picture of Great-aunt
Joanna. Her face flushed redder than Aunt
Eunice’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bad blood will always tell in the long run,” she
said bitterly. “To think of that child’s deceiving us
all summer, and then leaving us like that—after all
we had done for her—and without a word!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She left a letter for me, remember, Penelope.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The red patches in Penelope’s cheeks were throbbing.
Actually if she had been a child, you might
have thought she was going to cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t want to <i>see</i> her letter,” she snapped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s on the desk in the library,” Aunt Eunice told
her placidly.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you’ll believe it, Aunt Eunice never went near
the library all that afternoon. Whether or not
Penelope went there, only Penelope herself knew,
and she never told. Indeed there was little talk of
any sort that night at dinner, and when Penelope
spoke at last, this was what she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe we’d better rehang these pictures. I’m
really tired of looking at Great-aunt Joanna. I
think she’s badly painted, rather. Especially the
nose and the eyebrows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not change your seat?” Aunt Eunice suggested
gently.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was very quiet in the house, as Penelope had
said. All the quieter because Penelope did not touch
the piano. She said she was sure it was out of tune.
But the stillness of the house was broken next afternoon,
when Mrs. Wheeler Trowbridge and Mrs.
Francis Holden came to call.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had heard the story of the turned-about
girls. Hadn’t all Longmeadow heard it in one form
or another and nothing lost in the telling? They
were very sympathetic with Aunt Eunice and Cousin
Penelope, on whom two sly children had played such
a disgraceful, downright wicked trick, and they
gave them long accounts of how they themselves
managed their children, who never were guilty of
any naughtiness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cats!” said Penelope after the callers had gone.
She was not in the habit of so far losing control of
herself as to call people names, but she had neither
eaten nor slept as she should in the last hours. “I
simply cannot stand these visits of condolence. I’m
going to Boston to-morrow for a couple of days.
Will you come with me, Mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve just got home,” Aunt Eunice answered,
after a moment. “I don’t think I’ll go jaunting
again so soon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll be rather—lonely here, won’t you?” said
Penelope. She hesitated a second, then she spoke
quickly, and without looking at her mother. “Why
don’t you send for that child to make you a little
visit? You know you’re dying to see her again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They looked at each other, and suddenly Aunt
Eunice’s old face, that seemed so soft, was a grim
mask of obstinacy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Penelope,” she said. “She’s not coming into
this house on any little visit. She’s had the wrench
of leaving here once—and once is enough. She’s
got to forget us, and forget The Chimnies. It’s the
kindest way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, of course,” Penelope agreed haughtily. “I
spoke on impulse—a very foolish impulse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice smiled, but so fleetingly that
Penelope, brooding on her own thoughts, never marked
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Penelope went to the city and was gone a day, and
a night, and most of another day. She came home
with a lot of boxes. She had done a little shopping,
she said. There was much to talk about that night
at dinner—relatives that Penelope had seen in Boston,
and new things in the shops. Penelope talked
quite gayly, perhaps because her seat at table had
been changed, and she no longer had to face the
mocking eyes of Great-aunt Joanna, who like all
Longmeadow, she felt, was laughing at her, and
with reason!</p>

<p class='c009'>Over the coffee in the library, by the soft light of
the candles, Aunt Eunice at last began in her turn to
tell what she had been doing. She had been to tea
yesterday at the Holdens. She had attended a
meeting of the Sewing Guild that afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And last evening,” she ended mildly, “I had
Martha Conway here for a good long talk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” said Penelope, with a queer smile. “While
the cat’s away, Mother? Well—how’s that niece of
hers?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice stirred her coffee attentively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Little Caroline’s mother seems to have been an
exceptionally fine woman,” she said at length. “One
could see that from the child’s pretty ways. Quite
gifted musically, too. There are no near relatives
on the mother’s side. On the father’s side Martha
is the child’s nearest of kin, and her guardian.
Martha has all she can do to provide for her own
children, and the two babies she’s already taken.
She’s a good woman if ever there was one! She’ll
do the best she can for Caroline, but she wouldn’t
stand in the child’s light, and indeed I think she’d
be relieved if some one else——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Penelope laughed outright, and there was something
very like relief in her laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You blessed old schemer!” she said. “Why don’t
you do what you’ve been pining to do ever since the
little girl went out of this house? Have her here to
stay—indefinitely.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice smiled, but she shook her head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Martha Conway is as set as I am against any
idea of visits,” she said. “It’s not fair to the child
to accustom her to our way of living, and then at
seventeen or eighteen turn her off, untrained, to
take care of herself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was silence—silence in which the very room
seemed to wait for a decision on which lives depended.
Then Penelope rose to her feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you’ll excuse me,” she said, in an aloof voice,
“I’m going up to bed early. Really, this Boston
trip has quite fagged me out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She went away to her room—the room next to the
green and golden nest where Caroline had lain so
many nights, and been so happy. Whether she read
or wrote or merely sat with her own thoughts, nobody
knows. At any rate she didn’t sleep as she
had said she should.</p>

<p class='c009'>About eleven o’clock that same night when Aunt
Eunice, in her soft dressing-sack of gray and golden
crêpe, with a lacy cap on her white hair, sat propped
up in her bed, reading (if you’ll believe it!) “Alice
in the Looking Glass,” there came a knock at her
door. When Aunt Eunice called: “Come in!”
Penelope herself trailed into the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Penelope had on the lavender dressing-gown that
Caroline loved her in. Her face was quite pale, and
her eyes looked big, but rather starlike. She came
and stood at the foot of the big mahogany bed, with
its four pillars, and facing Aunt Eunice, spoke
breathlessly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother, I wouldn’t for the world stand in the
way of what would give <i>you</i> happiness. After all,
this little Caroline comes of good honest Longmeadow
blood on her father’s side, and her mother
seems to have been more than all right. And the
child is gifted—no doubt about that. You should
hear Woleski rave over her. So you go ahead and
adopt her, Mother! Don’t mind <i>me</i>. I’m sure I
shan’t ever raise the slightest objection.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Eunice looked down at the passage she had
been reading in her book. It was the place where
Alice reaches the lovely garden, where she wishes to
be, simply by walking away from it. Aunt Eunice
thought very highly of “Alice in the Looking Glass.”
She called it the work of a philosopher, and an excellent
rule of conduct. She closed the book carefully,
over her finger that still kept the place.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Adopting a child isn’t like adopting a puppy or
a kitten,” she spoke musingly. “It’s a responsibility,
and one shouldn’t undertake it, unless one is
pretty sure of seeing it through. Now I’m seventy-one,
and when I go, there’s no way of my providing
for Caroline. Our property is trusteed, as you know,
and when I’m done with it, it’s absolutely yours, to
do with as you please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They looked at each other, the two of them.
Then Penelope cried passionately:</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I <i>won’t</i> adopt her, Mother. I <i>can’t</i>! After
what I’ve said of the Meadows children—after
what every one has heard me say—all my life. My
pride wouldn’t <i>let</i> me!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Penelope!” The words on Aunt Eunice’s
lips were just a breath of pain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, say it—say it!” Penelope cried, in a
breaking voice. “Isn’t it what I’m saying to myself?
If it hadn’t been for my pride, years ago—if I’d
taken back some silly words I never meant—Jack
would have stayed in Longmeadow—Jack would
have married me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Penelope—my baby!” Aunt Eunice cried the
words in amazement and in pity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t you know—didn’t you ever guess?” Penelope’s
voice was no more than a whisper. “That
was why he went. I drove away the only man I loved—and
if I could do that—for pride, and nothing else—I
can put this wretched child out of my heart—and
I’ll do it, I tell you, I’ll do it, even if it <i>kills</i> me!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXLIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XLIII<br /> <br />IN THE MEADOWS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Caroline, all unaided, had baked a “toad in
the hole” for dinner. Do you know what
“toad in the hole” is? Scraps of meat baked in a
deep dish, in a kind of custard batter. Caroline had
learned from Cousin Delia how to make it. She
was remembering now all sorts of things she had
forgotten since she left Cousin Delia—all the things
she had let herself forget at The Chimnies. She
and Nellie had washed the dinner dishes, and then
Caroline had scrubbed the kitchen floor and polished
the stove, as a surprise for Aunt Martha. She did
so want to show Aunt Martha that she could be as
helpful as Jackie, even if she <i>was</i> a “scare batty” (as
Neil called her) in regard to cows.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Caroline, in her Peggy Janes and sneakers,
which Jacqueline had run down at the heels very
badly, was out in the barn with Nellie and the babies.
Nellie had brought along her cloth doll, a lumpy
creature named Gertrude, and Caroline was making
it a dress, out of some pieces of calico that Grandma
had unearthed from her scrap-bag.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mildred looked on in a stately, rather disapproving
manner. Mildred wore a little dress of ruffled
dimity, pink with a fine white stripe, and a pink
sunbonnet. All Mildred’s silks and satins, which
Aunt Eunice and Caroline had made in the summer
house for Mildred to wear in foreign climes, were
packed away in the satin box in the bureau drawer in
the north chamber. Caroline had cried a little as
she laid them away. She didn’t mean to look at
them again for a long time—not till she was able to
forget that life at The Chimnies had been real—not
till she was able to think of it, as she hoped to think
of it some day, as a lovely dream that she should
always cherish.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sunlight came through the big rear door of
the barn, and crept farther and farther into the dusk
that smelled of cows and new hay, as the sun moved
nearer to the western hills. “To-night it is Saturday
night,” Caroline remembered the first line of a little
child-song that her mother sometimes used to sing
to her. To-morrow would be Sunday, and then her
second week at the farm would begin, and after
it weeks and weeks, and months, and years would
follow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there’ll be lots of chances to slide,” Caroline
kept repeating to herself, “and Ralph will teach me
how to skate—he said so himself! And Grandma
is going to show me how to knit. Maybe I can knit
things for Christmas presents. If only I could crochet
a sweater for poor Gertrude, like the one
Muzzy made for Mildred.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look-it! Look-it!” Freddie cried suddenly, and
Nellie, all excited, raised her voice at the same
moment: “It’s an automobile, comin’ into our yard—it’s
a limousine!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline lifted her eyes from her sewing, and
looked. She recognized the car in a single glance.
It was the limousine that she had so enjoyed riding
in—Aunt Eunice’s own car. It was stopping at the
door of the farm. Oh, cried guilty conscience, here
was Cousin Penelope—Jacqueline’s Cousin Penelope!—come
accusingly, as Caroline had always
feared she would come, to tell Caroline what she
thought of people who pretended to be other people,
and let you be good to them, with dentists and
pianos, and all the time were deceiving you!</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline dropped Gertrude, so violently that it
was well she was not made of anything more breakable
than painted cloth and cotton. She caught up
Mildred in a frantic clasp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mind the babies, Nellie!” she bade. “I
won’t come back till she’s gone, not even if she stays
here ten thousand years!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She scuttled out at the rear of the barn, just as
the stately limousine came to rest alongside the
kitchen door. She ran round to the south side of the
barn, where there was a pile of old lumber, and a
disused hen-house. She crawled into the hen-house—she
wasn’t very big in the Peggy Janes!—through
a hole that looked hardly large enough for a good-sized
dog.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was hot and rather stifling in the hen-house,
but Caroline felt as safe as if she were in a diving-bell
at the bottom of the sea. She cuddled in a
corner and held Mildred tight and comforted her.
She was just assuring Mildred that there was nothing
to fear, for Cousin Penelope would go away very
soon, and then they would crawl out where it was
cooler, when she heard steps close at hand, and the
rustle of garments among the tall weeds by the
lumber pile, and voices.</p>

<p class='c009'>One voice unmistakably belonged to Cousin
Penelope.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where <i>can</i> she have vanished to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I bet I know!” That shrill pipe was Nellie’s,
the little traitor! “I bet she’s gone and hid in the
old hen-house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But she couldn’t possibly have got in there,”
gasped Cousin Penelope.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Course she could,” insisted Nellie. “Want me
to crawl in and show you how?”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a second of silence, in which Nellie
evidently waited hopefully for Cousin Penelope to
say she would follow her through the hole into the
hen-house. But when Cousin Penelope did speak,
what she said was:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Run back to the house now, little girl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She spoke in the sort of tone that would make
any little girl run away. Nellie ran, no question!
But Cousin Penelope stayed. Caroline could almost
hear her breathing while she held her own breath
and listened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Caroline!” That was not a bit like the voice in
which Cousin Penelope had spoken to Nellie and it
came from a Cousin Penelope who must be kneeling
on the ground (Cousin Penelope kneeling!) in order
to throw the voice into the hen-house. “Are you in
there, dear? Please come out! I understand—I’m
not angry with you. We’ve all suffered enough—some
of us deserved it.” (Could it be that Cousin
Penelope was crying just a little?) “Come out, dear,
please! We’ve come to see you, Aunt Eunice and I.
You’re not afraid of Aunt Eunice, I know. Oh,
don’t be afraid of me any more!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Caroline wasn’t afraid of this Cousin Penelope—the
Cousin Penelope who had come to her
room on the night when it thundered and lightened—the
Cousin Penelope who had walked with her
on the downs. She crawled out of the hen-house,
with a long new rip in the Peggy Janes, and before
she could rise to her feet, she found herself and
Mildred fast in Cousin Penelope’s arms, and Cousin
Penelope, in her lovely white and green summery
things, was actually hugging a dusty Meadows child,
and kissing her—yes, kissing her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re coming home with us now, Caroline,”
Cousin Penelope whispered. Yes, she had been crying.
Caroline could feel that the cheek pressed
against her own was wet. And Caroline wanted to
cry, too, but she couldn’t.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no!” she said achingly. “Oh, no! I want
to like anything—but I couldn’t! I couldn’t bear
to go away again—I thought last time I was going
to die.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you’re not going away again, ever,” said
Cousin Penelope. “You’re coming home with us to
stay—always. Don’t you understand, dear? Aunt
Eunice wants you—and I want you, too, Caroline—I
want you to be my very own little girl.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXLIV' class='c010'>CHAPTER XLIV<br /> <br />“HAPPY EVER AFTER!”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Not more than fifteen minutes later Caroline
actually was riding away from the farm in
the gray-lined, soft-cushioned limousine. She sat
between Aunt Eunice and Cousin Penelope. She
had Mildred on her knee, and her old suitcase rested
on the rug at her feet. In the suitcase were her
comb and brushes and nightdress, the satin candy
box that held Mildred’s wardrobe, the old lacquer
box, tied with a crumpled hair-ribbon, the little
chintz cases, marked with the cross-stitched initials,
F. T., which were her mother’s initials, and the
worn bed-shoes that her mother had crocheted for
her months ago. All her other worldly goods
Caroline had bequeathed to an astonished Nellie.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha waved a good-by from the doorstep.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seeing folks off seems to be a habit of ours this
summer,” she said to Nellie and Dickie and Neil,
who stood looking after the departing limousine,
too dumbfounded at the disappearance of yet another
playmate to utter a single word.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then, at the very moment when it should have
happened, something nice did happen to Aunt
Martha and her brood. Ralph in the Ford came
clattering down the road, up which the limousine,
with the happiest little girl in the world inside, was
rolling so smoothly. He stopped the car at the
doorstep, and tumbled out in great excitement and
took from the tonneau a box. It was quite a big
box, addressed to Aunt Martha, and sent by parcel
post from a New York store.</p>

<p class='c009'>You had better believe there was an instant
chorus:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Open it, Mother, please! Right off! Please
do!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Martha had Ralph carry the box into
Grandma’s room, and the children all crowded
round, from little Annie, on Grandma’s knee, to
Ralph, who was as eager as the youngest. Aunt
Martha untied the nice stout string very carefully
and gave it to Grandma to roll up and save, and she
removed the strong wrapping paper and folded it,
to be put away in the drawer of the old dresser.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Candy!” cried Neil, as the corrugated paste-board
(Aunt Martha saved that, too!) was removed
from a stack of dazzling white boxes. “I
can just smell it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yumy-yumy!” sniffed Nellie in ecstasy.</p>

<p class='c009'>It certainly was candy, and sent in the most
thoughtful way, a box for each member of the family,
marked with his or her name. There were
chocolate-coated peppermints and gum-drops, her
favorite sweets (as Somebody knew!) in Grandma’s
box, and caramels of all kinds in Neil’s. There
were bon-bons of every luscious color in Nellie’s box,
and crystallized fruit in the one marked Ralph.
There were chocolates for Dickie and Caroline
(who wouldn’t need her box!) and there were fruit-drops
and chocolate-coated molasses chips for
Freddie, and dear little striped sticks of all colors
and flavors for Annie to suck. For Aunt Martha
there was the most beautiful two-pound box of
chocolates and bon-bons, and on top, among the
candied leaves of violets, was a card that read:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I hope this will poison any kid who goes and eats
it up on Aunt Martha.</p>

<div class='c013'><span class='sc'>Jackie</span>.“</div>

<p class='c014'>“Why, of course it’s Jackie,” smiled Grandma.
“Who else in the wide world would ever have
thought out everything so nice?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She shouldn’t have!” gasped Aunt Martha.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, gee!” cried Ralph. “There’s a letter for
you, and I guess it’s from her, and I was forgetting
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He took a letter from his pocket—a thick letter,
written on the paper of a New York hotel. The
writing left much to be desired in the way of beauty,
but it was readable, and it was identical with the
writing on the card in Aunt Martha’s box of candy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of all the extravagant young ones!” Aunt
Martha repeated, as she opened the envelope.
“Her folks shouldn’t have let her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she read the letter, but mostly to herself,
for she was so “flabbergasted” that her voice gave
out completely. This was the letter Jackie had
written:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Aunt Martha:</span></p>

<p class='c015'>I am here in New York at a hotel with a roof
garden with my Aunt Edie and Uncle Jimmie and we
sail on Saterday but it is not a strick school I am
going to. I have been shopping all day with Aunt
Edie and I boght some things and she said I could
and helped me sellect them and I hope you will take
them and let the children take them. They are
un-Christmas presents and if you do not take them I
shall think you are mad at me for what I did and I
shall be dretful unhappy if I think you are mad at
me so I hope you will take them please and if I was
there I could show Neil how the magic lantern goes.</p>

<p class='c015'>The things will be sent from the shops and they
are all adressed to you but I will tell you which is
for which. The wheel-chair is for Grandma of
course and the red silk wadded gown is for her to.
I got a cherful color and the long taled birds on it
are not storks but cranes. The dishes are a present
to the house and I tried to get green dragons but
they do not seem populer any more so I got green
leaves and pink rosebuds. The wooly rabbit is for
Annie and when you press him he jumps and the
bonnet is for her to because she will be so cunning
with swans down round her face. The kiddy kar
is for Freddie and the curly haired doll is for Nellie.
The sutecase goes with the doll and there are three
dresses and a coat and a hat and her shoes and
stockings take off and she shuts her eyes. The magic
lantern is for Neil and he doesn’t need any more
slides because you can use postcards like the
directions say and I will send him odles of postcards
from Europe. The Boy Scout suit is for Dickie. I
think he is average twelve years old but if it isnt
right you can send it back to the shop and they will
change it. The belt is for Ralph and his initials
are on the buckle so of course there could be no
misstake and the fur gloves are for you in the car
next winter if you will please accept them with my
love. The little straw hat is for Mildred that is
Carol’s child and the winter coat with the fur collar
is for Carol to and tell her please I will write her a
long letter from the steamer. I can’t write any more
now because I have a crick in my hand and anyway
it is prety near dinner time. I hope you are all very
well and do not forget me and I remain as ever
most respectfully</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“My land!” said Aunt Martha, when she had
finished and found her breath. “They shouldn’t have
let her—big presents like that—and I ought not to
let you children——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Has my doll real hair that I can brush?” Nellie
interrupted, with shining eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A red silk gown with long-tailed birds on it!”
Grandma shook with laughter. “I’ll look like the
Queen of Sheba. Lord bless the child! At my
time o’ life!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She peered into her box of sweets, and chose
herself a plump sugary gum-drop.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to let you take ’em, just the same,”
said Aunt Martha, with decision. “There’s no
sense in standing on your pride to the hurt of other
folks’ feelings when it’s kindly meant and the things
a real Godsend. She must have taken a lot of
thought and time—and that’s more than money!—picking
out presents for all of us, and just when
she’d be full of her own plans and pleasures, too!
She’s a dear, good child.” Aunt Martha blew her
nose quite savagely. “Only you don’t need to go
imitating <i>all</i> her qualities, remember!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s a crackerjack.” Neil spoke as well as he
could with his mouth full of caramels.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now put up that candy, every one of you, till
morning!” Aunt Martha tucked away her handkerchief
and was her brisk self again. “I can’t have
you all sick on my hands. And put Caroline’s box
to one side. It’s hers and must go to her, whether
she’s here or at the Gildersleeves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But what was a box of chocolates to Caroline in
that hour? The limousine had rolled up to the
porch, down which she had stumbled in heart-broken
flight, not a week before. She stood again
in the dim spacious hall, with its gleam of gilt-framed
mirrors and its tall, flaming gladioli in dull
green jars. She had gone up the stairs into the
room with the pale gray furniture, the fairy-tale
pictures, the canary shapes that glittered amid the
green.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will always be your room now, dear,” said
Aunt Eunice, and patted Caroline’s hand that she
had kept fast in hers, ever since they found each
other at the farm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope pulled open a drawer of the
bureau. She took out things while Aunt Eunice
gasped, as amazed and as delighted, too, as Caroline
herself. There were white frilly underthings for a
little girl of eleven, and socks of black silk, and
shoes of black patent leather, with buckled straps.
There was a frock of fine brown and white checked
gingham, with flame-colored silk stitchings on the
belt and cuffs and collar, and a little chemisette of
sheer white lawn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I got these in the city,” said Cousin Penelope,
smiling and unashamed. “I was going to send them
to you, Carol, as a present for Sunday wear.
There’s a little coat, too, in the closet and a fall
hat. To-morrow we’ll go to the city, and get you
more things, and we’ll go to the dentist’s, too, and
Madame Woleski will take you for a lesson the
last of the week.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And when the sun went down on that Saturday
night, in great splashes of color into the sea, Jacqueline
was a happy little girl, as she stood with feet
firmly apart on the deck of the great ocean liner,
at her Uncle Jimmie’s side, with new sights and
new experiences in a new world before her. But
she was not half so happy as was Caroline, all clean
and fresh in clothes that were her very own, not
Jacqueline’s, as she sat at the table in the softly
lighted dining room at The Chimnies and beamed
at Aunt Eunice and Cousin Penelope. For Caroline
was telling herself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“They want me—really me myself—not Jackie.
I’m theirs—and they love me, but oh! not more
than I love them, and will love them all my days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But if you’ll believe it, Cousin Penelope was as
happy as anybody. For she had changed back to her
old place at the table, and she looked straight at
Great-aunt Joanna’s portrait. Blood will tell—once
more she said it defiantly! Weren’t the Taits and
Conways and Gildersleeves and Holdens, all those
sturdy pioneers who were her forbears, just as much
the forbears of little Caroline?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know, Mother,” said Cousin Penelope
serenely, “Caroline really looks very much like
Great-aunt Joanna?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caroline twisted round in her seat. She didn’t
feel afraid to look at Great-aunt Joanna, now that
she wasn’t pretending to be her great-grandniece.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She looks fiercely proud, doesn’t she, Cousin
Penelope?” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cousin Penelope laughed. They were all three
very quick to laugh that evening, perhaps because
they could as easily have cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, pride’s a good thing,” said Cousin Penelope,
and the look that passed between her and Aunt
Eunice was a look of new understanding. “That is,
it’s a good thing if you know when to use it—and
when to lose it.”</p>
